qep'a'vo' cheghpu' Hoch 'e' vItul.

It seems unfair for me to be the one to reveal all of the new words from 
the qep'a', but I don't want to keep the qep'a' jeSbe'wI'pu' in the dark 
for too long. If anyone else wants to tell about the third word we received 
(or add details about the others that I may have missed), please do so.

This word was given towards the end of the Hokey Pokey. Since we had been 
given {Sa'Hut} at a previous qep'a' Hokey Pokey, it wasn't a jaw-dropping 
surprise, 'ach jIbepbe' jIH. I didn't have the word written on a card in 
front of me, but from what I heard, the new word is the noun {lev}, meaning 
"roof of mouth" or "hard pallete". Note that this appears to be a homonym [[pallete:=palate]] 
of the verb {lev} meaning "move betleH from vertical to horizontal 
orientation".

Stay tuned for the third and final new word: It's a verb!
