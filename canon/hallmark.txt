<tr>
  <th>Gowron
  <td>{Qapla'}
    <br><<Greetings!>>
<tr>
  <th>Gowron
  <td>{pIj maSuvpu' batlh maSuvpu' 'ej maQapbejta'}
    <br><<In our many battles, we have fought with honor and achieved...
      victory!>>

  <td>{vaj malopmeH tlhIHvaD nob SaSuqpu'}
    <br><<So to celebrate, I’ve gotten you all a gift.>>

  <td>{tlhIngan toQDujHom 'oH}
    <br><<It’s a Klingon Bird-of-Prey ornament.>>
<tr>
  <th>Crewman 1
  <td>{toQDujna' rurchu'}
    <br><<It looks so real!>>
<tr>
  <th>Crewman 2
  <td>{Qapqu' wovmoHbogh janHommey}
    <br><<It even has working lights!>>
<tr>
  <th>Speaker
  <td>Hallmark introduces the exclusive Klingon keepsake ornament. Call
    1-800-HALLMARK for a Gold Crown store near you.
<tr>
  <th>Crewman 1
  <td>({peghmo' ... }) [?!?]
    <br><<That was real nice of him.>>
<tr>
  <th>Crewman 2
  <td>{HIja'} &lt;gibberish&gt; {wISuqnIS} [??]
    <br><<Yeah, we should get him a thank you card.>>
</table>

The last two lines are badly garbled. Whatever gibberish Crewman 2 is saying,
from the verb prefix {wI-} it should be a singular object noun, probably formed
from {tlho'} (v) <<thank>> or {tlho'} (n) <<appreciation, gratitude>> --
*{tlho'meH nav/ghItlh} “thank you card”?

> **Marc Okrand:** “I haven’t seen the commercial in a while, but I don’t think
> {wov} was used as a noun there. Though the Klingons in the ad may have ad
> libbed a bit, the phrase the one Klingon was supposed to say regarding the
> little lights in the Bird of Prey ornament was: ‘{wovmoHbogh janHommey}’.
> That is, <<little devices that cause (something) to be light or bright>> or
> <<little devices that brighten (something)>> or <<little devices that light
> (something) up>> or the like. {wov} is a verb <<be light, bright>> followed
> by the suffix {-moH} <<cause>> (thus, <<cause to be light>>).” [[News
