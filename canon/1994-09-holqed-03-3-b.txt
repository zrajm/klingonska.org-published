{chuvmey}

Talking with Marc Okrand it's difficult to stay focused on a narrow point
of grammal; other bits and pieces of {tlhIngan Hol} lore crept in here and
there during an hour long chat, snippets which didn't quite lend themselves
to the interview on {-ghach}, as definitive a case of leftovers as one could
imagine.

     Those mystery words from <PK> can be revealed at last. <mate with> is
{ngagh}, and <get off> is actually {lItHa'}

     And finally, somewhat back on the target: the origin of {-ghach}. It all stems
from poor Worf's fate, his decision to take on the <discommendation>. Having
the verb {naD} making {naDHa'} was simple enough, but what to do for a
nominal form? Enter the ever-popular {-ghach}! But we can't blame Worf, or
even his father, for as we all know Mogh was <not> a traitor. If you want to
blame {-ghach} on someone, blame the house of Duras.
