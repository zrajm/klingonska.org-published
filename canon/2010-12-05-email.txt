"Finally, someone last year asked for the word for "picture." At first, Maltz
wondered why {nagh beQ} wasn't good enough. But then he thought about it some
more and said that another word, {mIllogh}, could be used for any sort of
depiction, including drawings, photographs, cartoons, icons on 21st-century
computers, and so on." (Posting to Facebook group {tlhIngan Hol jatlhwI'pu'},

SKI: As Quvar's emails to the list are still going awry, he's authorised QeS
to announce that a new word has been revealed: {mIllogh} "picture, (visual)
depiction".
