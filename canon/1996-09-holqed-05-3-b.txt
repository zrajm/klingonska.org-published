Everyday Klingon

The Klingon cards from the fifth season of <Star Trek: The Next Generation>
have come to our attention, and SkyBox International Inc appears to
have more than made up for the brief content of season four (reprinted in
the last issue of <{HolQeD}>).  The cards' text is again attributed to Marc Okrand
suggesting that these are canonical phrases.


        S25    {tlhIngan vaS'a'}    Klingon Great Hall

    {juHqo'Daq vaS'a' tu'lu'.  ngoch luchermeH 'ej wo' San luwuqmeH

    On the Homeworld, there is a great hall where the leaders of the
    Klingon High Council meet to determine policy and decide upon
    the fate of the Empire.  Gowron currently presides, named leader of
    the High Council by Captain Jean-Luc Picard, who was acting as
    Arbiter of Succession.


        S26    {lurSa' be'etor je}    Lursa and B'Etor

    {DuraS tuq tlhIngan yejquv patlh luDub 'e' reH lunIDtaH DuraS

    The sisters of the House of Duras, Lursa and B'Etor, are constantly [[B'Etor,:=B'Etor]]
    seeking a higher standing for the House of Duras within the Klingon
    High Council.  To this end, the sisters have acted against Gowron,
    going as far as to work with Romulan factions in order to gain
    power.


        S27    {Qo'noS}    Klingon Homeworld

    {tlhIngan wo' yuQmey chovlu'chugh Qo'noS potlh law' Hoch

    The principal planet of the Klingon Empire, {Qo'noS} is usually
    referred to as simply "The Homeworld."  This is where the Klingon
    Great hall is located, the center of the Klingon government.  {Qo'noS} [[hall:=Hall]]
    is a class-M planet with an oxygen/nitrogen atmosphere.
