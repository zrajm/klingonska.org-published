By the way, did I mention that the message from Maltz was a long 
message? ;-) Here is another word from it:

<<<<<<
The word for monastery is {ghIn}.  This is a pretty general term for a 
religious community (and the term "religious" could be interpreted in 
various ways as well), so it can be modified.  A {ghIn'a'} would be a 
pretty important monastery, for example.

Qapla',
   Quvar.

PS: For your records, I will post the complete message after I have 
revealed *all* the words. Let's call it a christmas-present.
