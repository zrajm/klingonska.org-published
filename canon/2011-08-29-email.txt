Marc Okrand wrote The Klingon Dictionary after Star Trek III was
filmed. Everything in the movie should be consistent with TKD.
Christopher Lloyd (Kruge) in particular took great pride in getting
his lines right.

Only Cathie Shirriff (Valkris) was filmed without benefit of on-set
coaching. It's her peculiar take on pronunciation which gives us the
variant words {jaw} for "lord" and {HISlaH} for "yes".

Most of the dialect stuff in PK and KGT comes from the TV series,
which was produced without anyone in a position to control things
really understanding how the pronunciation was supposed to work.

> I know how much retconning goes into correcting errors in Star Trek, and I really don't know if there's any more information available on dialects.

There's enough information in KGT for some of the more skilled
speakers of tlhIngan Hol to be able to carry on extended dialogue "in
dialect" and understand each other.
