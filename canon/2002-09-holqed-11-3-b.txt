More From Maltz [[From:=from]]

On his drive up to attend {qep'a'
HutDIch}, it is believed that
Marc Okrand was in communication
with Maltz (the precise mechanics
responsible for this are unknown
and unimportant to the present
concern). Traffic along the interstate
was particularly heavy, a topic
which at some point entered into
the conversation.
     Dr. Okrand reports that Matlz [[Matlz:=Maltz]]
volunteered the Klingon term
{Hutvagh}, a noun, meaning <too many
people or things in a place all at once>.
Maltz further indicated that the
term was used as a word play, a
substitution for the more common
{Qu'vatlh} which might otherwise be
heard in such situations.
