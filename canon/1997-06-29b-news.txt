I agree that a "complete" (or at least "as complete as possible") Klingon
Dictionary would be a good thing to have.  In fact, I'd been mulling over
something sort of along those lines as a next project for me (and for
Maltz, of course).  There are currently, however, no official or concrete
plans to come out with one, but as long as interest in Klingon (language
and culture and history and so on) remains high (as it certainly is now),
anything's possible.
