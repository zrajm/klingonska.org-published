  Summary: Transcript of the Klingon glossary from "Diplomatic Implausibility"
    by Keith R.A. DeCandido (ISBN 978-0671785543, published 1 February 2001).
    The acknowledgements section of this book remarks that Marc Okrand kept the
    "linguistics straight and vetted the glossary" and it is generally assumed
    that the Klingon used herein is canon.

]][[p.241]]

Most of the language actually being spoken in this novel is the [[is:=is in]]
Klingon tongue, and has been translated into English for the
reader’s ease. Some terms that don’t have direct translations into
English have been left in the Klingon language. Since that lan-
guage does not use Arabic characters, the transliterations of the [[Arabic:=Latin]]
Klingon terms vary, depending on preference. In many cases, a
more Anglicized transliteration is used instead of the <tlhIngan Hol>
transliterations preferred by linguists (e.g., the more Anglicized
<bat’leth> is preferred over the <tlhIngan Hol> spelling <betleH>).

    Below is a glossary of the Klingon terms used. Anglicized
spellings are in {boldface;} <tlhIngan Hol> transliterations are in {<bold
italics.>} Where applicable, episode or movie citations are given
where the term first appeared. Episode citations are followed by an
abbreviation indicating show: TNG=<The Next Generation,>
DS9=<Deep Space Nine.>

    {bat’leth} <{(betleH)}> Curved, four-bladed, two-handed weapon.
This is the most popular handheld, edged weapon used by Klingon
