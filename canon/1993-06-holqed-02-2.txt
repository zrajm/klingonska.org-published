Letters to the Editor

<Marc Okrand>
     This is just a brief note to tell you and your contributors how much I
look forward to receiving and reading each issue of <{HolQeD}>.

     As you may know, I began my studies of the Klingon language a number
of years ago and presented some preliminary findings in <TKD>. The language
is a tricky one, however; there are details to be discovered or better
understood. Further study is both welcome and necessary, <{HolQeD}> and the
Klingon Language Institute are performing an important service by letting
those interested in the language come together to share ideas and learn from
each other. The analyses, comments, and criticisms in <{HolQeD}> are
informative and thought provoking, and the work of the Institute will help
us achieve not only a better understanding of the Klingon language, but of
Klingon culture as well. I applaud your efforts and look forward to your
continuing success.

PS -- I'm glad you chose the name <{HolQeD}> for your journal. When Maltz
began telling me about his language, he used this word from time to time to
refer to what I was doing. For reasons now forgotten, the word was left out
of <TKD>.
