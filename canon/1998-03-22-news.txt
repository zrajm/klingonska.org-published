Thanks for the nice words about the books.

For people new to the language, it's important to remember
(as DloraH pointed out) that there's often not a
one-for-one equivalence between Klingon words and English
words.  That doesn't mean that it's impossible to express
some particular idea in one language or the other; it's
just that you have to get at what you mean in a different
way.  It may be that what's an individual word in one
language is expressed by a phrase or a suffix or something
in another.
