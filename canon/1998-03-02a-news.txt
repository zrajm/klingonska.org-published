Learning about Klingon character or mindset by way of studying what Qermaq
terms "defaults" in vocabulary will probably lead to interesting insights. 
I think both Qermaq and SuStel are on the right track: {par} "dislike," for
example, is probably the more neutral or expected reaction of a Klingon to
someone else; {parHa'} "like" (or, more revealingly, "not dislike" or
"undislike" or "misdislike"  or even "disdislike" [?!], since it's made up
of {par} "dislike" plus {-Ha'}, the negative suffix implying that something
is undone or done wrongly) is a modification (an undoing?) of this expected
reaction. 

It may be that not everything has a default.  Note, for example, {QuchHa'}
"be unhappy" and {'IQ} "be sad."  These two words don't mean quite the same
thing: {QuchHa'} is made up of {Quch} "be happy" plus the negative suffix
{-Ha'}, suggesting a change from being happy to not being happy. {'IQ} does
not have this connotation, nor does {Quchbe'} "be not happy" (or, if you
prefer, "not be happy").  Nevertheless, is the default in this pair {Quch}
"be happy" or is it {'IQ} "be sad"? 

On the other hand, when the only way to express a certain idea is by
modifying a word (for example, by adding a suffix) rather than using an
entirely different word, perhaps one can argue that the nonmodified word is
the default.  Thus, the only (known) way to express the opposite of {par}
"dislike" is by adding a negative suffix to {par}.  Unlike {QuchHa'} "be
unhappy" and {'IQ} "be sad," there's no choice when it comes to "like";
you've got to use a word based on {par}: {parHa'}.  It appears that the
only kind of "like" there is is the "undoing" or "misapplication" of
"dislike."  (Of course, you could also say {parbe'} "like" or, more
literally, "not dislike,"  using the negative suffix {-be'} "not"; but
{parbe'} is also based on {par}.  {parHa'} is heard more frequently than
{parbe'}, however, and this may be a hint at the usual way a Klingon looks
at things.) 

Interestingly (and bolstering the idea that "dislike" is a default),
there's also the word {muS} "hate" (which is presumably stronger somehow
than {par} "dislike").  It also has no known opposite except for the
suffixed forms:  {muSHa'} "dis-hate" or "unhate"; {muSbe'} "not hate."
