SuStel --
Thanks for your note.  If anyone didn't understand what SuStel said, write
back and I (or he) will translate.  I hope those who prefer to do this in
English (or a mixture of English and Klingon) will write as well. 

In the meantime, for SuStel and others who feel comfortable with Klingon...
