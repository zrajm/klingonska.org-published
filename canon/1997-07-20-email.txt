This appears in the newest New Words List which I intend to post 
tonight (and perhaps ~mark may be so kind as to get it on the 
Web soon thereafter):

vegh - to go through (v)

Note that this does mean:

A man goes through an open door, a bird goes through an open 
window or a woman goes through a tunnel.

Note that it explicitly does NOT mean:

A man's fist goes through a closed door, an arrow goes through a 
bird's heart or a woman goes through a forest.

This was the word the winning team at qep'a' loSDIch won from 
Okrand as their grand prize. Not being on said winning team, I 
shall end my comments here.
