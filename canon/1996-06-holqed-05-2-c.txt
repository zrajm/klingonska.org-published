  Summary: Gives words {nav HablI'} <fax> and {ghogh HablI'} <telephone>, and a
    discussion aspect of whether or not {Hoch} can be used so mean ‘all except
    for what I’m specifying to the contrary’ -- Marc Okrand instead suggest
    {le'be'} <unexceptional> or <nonspecific> for this.

{chuvmey}

A few months back several KLI members had eagerly provided assistance
to Mark Mandel of Dragon Systems for the voice recognition work on the
recent <Star Trek: Klingon> CD-ROM.  Mark sent each of us a "thank you" note,
written in English, romanized Klingon, and {pIqaD}.  Before mailing it though
he was able to get Marc Okrand to evaluate some new vocabulary.  Their
exchange appears below:

<Mark Mandel>
I'm setting up some Dragon letterhead for thank-you letters to all my
volunteer speakers. I'm replacing the standard text with Klingon in the
KLIpIqaDmey uppercase font, the useable one that the KLI uses, and running [[useable:=usable]]
<TKD> transliteration and English along the bottom.  I'm pretty confident of
my grammar and vocab., but if this is to smack in any way of officialness I'd
like to be sure.

    phone {rI'mI'}
    fax {navHablI'}

Since we have several fax numbers, and the general-purpose one comes out
at the front desk in the other building, I always give out the number of the
nearest machine for faxes to me.  So:

    general fax {Hoch navHablI'} [at front desk]

(as opposed to {tlhIngan Hol navHablI'}, near me) leaning on the
construction A Q {law' Hoch} Q {puS,} which takes {Hoch} not as literal 'all' but
as a generalization, sort of 'all except for what I'm specifying to the
contrary.'

<[Which produced the following reply from Marc Okrand:]>

<Marc Okrand>
I don't think I've actually had to come up with words for "telephone" or
"fax" before.  Anyway, I like your version of "fax" (though I'd probably make
it two words: {nav HablI'}).  For "phone," I think I'd do something parallel to
your "fax": {ghogh HablI'} ("voice transceiver").

As for {Hoch} for "general" -- that works, if you consider {Hoch} to mean
"everyone" (so the front desk fax is the "everyone fax").  The only problem
there is that it could be misinterpreted as "all (the) fax machines," since a
plural suffix on nouns is never required.  Perhaps an alternative is to use
{le'be'} "unexceptional," which might also be translated "nonspecific" or the
like ({nav HablI' le'be'}).
