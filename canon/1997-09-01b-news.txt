Good question!

I didn't have my oscilloscope handy when Maltz was explaining all of this. 
Nor my tricorder, which I suspect would have done an even better job of
analysis.

I'm not a musical theorist, but from what I can figure, the first <yu> and
the next <yu> are not an octave apart; they are a nonave apart.

Does that help?

(Actually, I suspect it's more like the charghwI' version -- though I'd
have to hear it and run it by Maltz again to be sure.)
