nuqneH?

This is just a quick note to welcome everybody to this bbs.  I'm looking 
forward to hearing (rather, seeing) what you think about the Klingon language, 
what works, what frustrates you, what you're up to, and so on.

There are more and more people communicating in Klingon these days, some of 
them very expertly and some just beginning to get their tongues in shape.  In 
order to include everybody, I'll be writing in Federation Standard most of the 
time.  But if you want to write in Klingon, please do!

DaH maloS.  peghItlh!

Qapla'!
