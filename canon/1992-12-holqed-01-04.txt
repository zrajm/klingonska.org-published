Numerals

Lawrence M. Schoen

In the first issue of <{HolQeD}> I put forth a short piece describing two Klingon
writing systems in popular use and for which I had designed digital
typefaces (i.e., "laserfonts").  Through a small oversight no numerals were
shown, and the Klingon Language Institute has received a surprising number
of inquiries regarding them.  So, at last, here they are.

     From the Mandel writing system, generally considered to be a simple
cipher of the Roman alphabet, and published in the <U.S.S. Enterprise Officer's
Manual>:

     [[Image: Mandel numerals
         0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
     ]]

     And from the syllabary created by Astra Image Corporation (though
usually attributed to <ST:TNG> Scenic Designer Michael Okuda):

     [[Image: {pIqaD} numerals
