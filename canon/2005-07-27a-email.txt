Okay, I'll step up.

The word is {bop}, it's a verb meaning "be all about (something)."  So for
example, {HolQeD bopbe' paqvam} "this book is not all about linguistics."  

Here's the story:

It was during the cabaret, and Krankor observed that it's difficult to
*really* do the Hokey Pokey in Klingon without being able to say "and that's
what it's all about."  In years past, it's all sung in English, except for
the actual names of the body parts.  "You put your qIvon in, you put your
qIvon out..." and so on.

So Marc asked Krankor, if the word, were, say {bop}, how would you use it?
Krankor replied that he'd say {'e' bop} "that's what it's all about."  To
which Marc responded, "that's what it is."

So now we can really do the Hokey Pokey in Klingon.  And *that's* what it's
all about.
