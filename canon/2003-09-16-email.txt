The introduction of the word {Sa'Hut} was rather memorable - just imagine a 
circle of Klingonists doing the hokey pokey (like we do at every qep'a'). 
If you aren't familiar with it, the song goes more or less:

[going around the circle of people, the first person shouts a Klingon body 
part]
"You put your [body part] in
You put your [body part] out
You put your [body part] in and you shake it all about
You do the Hokey Pokey and you turn yourself around
That's what it's all about"

As we go around the circle, each person naming a body part, we get words 
like {DeSqIv}, {jat}, and for laughs, {qIvon}, {ngech}, and newer words 
such as {marwI'}. After Marc chose everyone's favorite word {'I'} the first 
time around the circle, we get to Marc again. Everyone quiets down to hear 
him say: {Sa'Hut}. For a moment, everyone is dumbfounded, including myself; 
He later said that the looks on our faces was priceless.
The neurons are firing in everyone's brains, obviously going down their 
mental list of body part vocabulary, or trying to figure out if they 
misheard Marc, or maybe they forgot one the obscure regional forehead 
words. And then when he puts his {Sa'Hut} in, everyone realizes that 
{Sa'Hut} is a new word, and we all follow suit with our own {Sa'HutDu'}.


The only other note-worthy "revelation" that I remember is the origin of 
the words {megh'an}, {'er'In}, and {qa'rI'}; these are explained on the 
Puns in Klingon Wiki page.
