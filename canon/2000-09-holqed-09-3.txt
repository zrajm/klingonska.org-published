{matlh jup mu'mey}

Marc Okrand

At the {qep'a' SochDIch} Nick
Nicholas was honored for his
continuing service to the mission
and goals of the KLI. He received the
title {matlh jupna'}. And, as a friend,
he was given the opportunity to ask
Maltz (via an intermediary) for a
single word.

     As has happened often in the
past, Maltz's reply (again, via the
intermediary) went beyond
providing simply Klingon glosses for
the specific word and included
additional terms and examples. Even
more surprising, Maltz seemed to
feel the need to go off in a second
direction , providing even more
insight for Klingon language
scholars. What follows are the notes
provided by the intermediary.


1. Kin

     Maltz was asked by a friend for
the Klingon word for "cousin." He
was happy to oblige, but before he
got to "cousin,"  he said he needed
to explain several other kinship
terms.

     There are four words for "aunt."
{me'} is used to refer to one's mother's
sister; {'e'mam} is one's father's sister.
An aunt by marriage (the wife of
one's parent's brother) is either
{me'nal} (mother's brother's wife) or
{'e'mamnal} (father's brother's wife).

     Similarly, there are four words
for "uncle." One's mother's brother
is {'IrneH} and one's father's brother
is {tennuS}. The husband of one's
mother's sister is {'IrneHnal}, and the
husband of one's father's sister is
{tennuSnal}.

     Now on to "cousin." The child
of one's {tennuS} or one's {me'} is
called a {tey'}, while the child of one's
{'IrneH} or one's {'e'mam} is called a
{lor}. But these words are also used
for "nephew" and "niece." A man
will use {tey'} to refer to the child of
his brother and {lor} to refer to the
child of his sister, while a woman
uses these terms the other way
around: {tey'} is the child of her sister
and {lor} is the child of her brother.
To specify gender, {loD} "male" and
{be'} "female" are added: {tey'loD} and
{lorloD} mean "nephew, male
cousin"; {tey'be'} and {lorbe'} mean
"niece, female cousin."

     If it is necessary to make a
distinction between a nephew/niece
and a cousin, one simply describes
the relationship. For example:
{loDnI' puqloD} "brother's son,
nephew"' {me' puqbe'} "mother's [["':="]]
sister's daughter, aunt's daughter,
cousin." Unless specifically
distinguishing between two
individuals or explaining exactly
how one is related to someone else,
however, {tey'} and {lor} are much
more common.

     (Maltz speculated that there
may be some connection between
the noun {tey'} "cousin, nephew,
niece" and the verb {tey'} "confide,"
since, at least according to Maltz,
one tends to be closer to, and
therefore more likely to confide in,
one's {tey'} than one's {lor}.)

     In addition to the specific
terminology referring to cousins and
siblings' offspring, there are four
words that are more general in
scope.

     {yur} is used for a more distant [[p.9]]
cousin or niece or nephew. This
would include second cousins,
grandnephews, and the like. {yur} is
not used to refer to a {lor} or a {tey'},
though the plural {yurpu'} may be
used to refer to a group consisting of
a {lor} or {tey'} or two along with some
other, more distant relatives.

     {vIn}, in its plural form {vInpu'}, is
used for a group consisting of at
least one {lor} and at least one {tey'}
and no one who is not a {lor} or a
{tey'}. Thus {vInpu'} may be translated
"cousins, nieces, nephews." If it's
not a mixed group, then, of course,
the plural forms of {lor} and {tey'}
would be used ({lorpu'}, {tey'pu'}).
{vInpu'} might also be used if the
speaker is unsure about the makeup
of the group (but sure enough to
know that {vInpu'} is a better choice
than {yurpu'}). The singular form,
{vIn}, is also sometimes used in place
of {lor} or {tey'} when focusing on the
{vIn} as a member of a group of
{vInpu'} as opposed to his or her
specific relationship to the speaker.

     {'e'nal} refers to someone who
married into the family, but does
not specify the exact relationship.

     {tuqnIgh} is used to refer to any
member of a house. Thus, {qeng
tuqnIgh} is "a member of the House
of Kang," and {tuqnIghwI'} is "a
member of my house."

     While he was at it, Maltz offered
several other kinship terms, but he
made it clear that his list was not
exhaustive (he left off words for 
"great-grandmother," "great- [[keep hyphen]]
grandson," "great aunt" and the
like). {puqnI'} is the word for
"grandchild." If it is necessary to
specify gender, {loD} or {be'} is added:
{punI'loD} "grandson," {puqnI'be'}
"granddaughter." Finally, there is a
special word for "firstborn":
{ghubDaQ}.


2. Basic math

     Maltz also explained how to talk
about simple arithmetic functions,
specifically addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division. There are
several ways of talking about such
things, but the most common
involves using the verbs {boq} "ally
with, form an alliance with" and
{chen} "take form."

     Examples should make the usage of these words clear.

     (a) Addition

     "4 + 3 = 7" would be {wej boq
loS; chen Soch} (literally, "four allies
with three; seven forms"). It is also
possible to reverse the two numbers
being added: {loS boq wej; chen
Soch}.

     Note that in these mathematical
constructions, the numbers, even
those higher than "one," are
considered singular from a
grammatical point of view. One says
{wa' boq cha'; chen wej} "2 + 1 = 3"
(two allies with one, three forms"),
not {wa' luboq cha'...} That is, the
prefix {lu-}, indicating a third person
plural subject and third person
singular object, is not used. The
subject ("two" in the example) is
considered singular.

     (b) Subtraction

     For subtraction, the suffix {-Ha'}
"undo" is attached to {boq} producing
{boqHa'}, literally "dis-ally" or
"dissociate from." Thus "4 - 3 = 1"
would be {loS boqHa' wej; chen wa'}
(literally, "three dissociates from
four, one forms").

     When subtracting, the subject
and object cannot be reversed
without changing the equation. {wej
boqHa' loS} would be "3 -- 4" and the [[p.10]]
answer would be a negative number
(a concept Maltz wanted to
postpone for another time).

     (c) Multiplication

     In Klingon, multiplication
involves a number allying with
itself. Thus, the suffix {-'egh}
"oneself" is used: {boq'egh} "ally with
oneself." It is the necessary to
specify how many times this alliance
occurs.

     For example, "2 x 3 = 6" would
be {cha'logh boq'egh wej; chen jav}
("twice, three allies with itself, six
forms"). The multiplier and
multiplicand may be reversed:
{wejlogh boq'egh cha'} ("3 x 2,"
"three times, two allies with itself").

     (d) Division

     Paralleling multiplication,
division in Klingon involves a
number dissociating from itself a
specific number of times. The verb
used is {boqHa''egh} "dis-ally from
oneself, dissociate from oneself,"
containing both {-Ha'} "undo" and
{-'egh} "oneself."

     For example, "6 / 3 = 2" is
{wejlogh boqHa''egh jav; chen cha'}
("three times, six dissociates from
itself, two forms"). Reversing the
dividend and the divisor changes
the equation. {javlogh boqHa''egh
wej} would be "3 / 6" and the answer
would be a fraction (another topic
Maltz didn't want to get into).
