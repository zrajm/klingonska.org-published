S31

Death Howl
Hegh bey

When a Klingon warrior dies or is killed, other Klingons may perform a
ceremonial howl or yell as part of the Klingon death ritual. The eyes of the
fallen Klingon are opened and others roar in a great crescendo. This yell
is victorious in nature, rather than mournful and also serves to warn the
other dead that a Klingon warrior is coming.
