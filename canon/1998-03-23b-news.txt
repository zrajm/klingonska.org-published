Since number is an optional category in Klingon (the plural suffix may be
left off even if the word refers to more than one thing), {DIr} may refer
to "a skin" or "skins" or "skin" as a material or substance.  Likewise for
{veDDIr} "pelt, pelts." 

So the problem of which plural suffix to use comes up only when one feels
the need to be very specific. 

If I understand Maltz correctly, it works like this: 

The general plural suffix {-mey} is not used with body parts (except by
poets, of course).  Thus {DIrmey} "skins"  and {veDDIrmey} "pelts" are not
(or, perhaps better, are no longer) body parts, but rather are materials
from which things (clothing or blankets, for example) may be made.  They've
lost their association with the creatures that originally had them.  (This
is kind of like the distinction in English between "beef," which is eaten,
and "cattle,"  which isn't.) 

If there still is that association, that is, if the creatures still have
their skin, or if it's a creature that has multiple skins (maybe layers,
maybe different kinds of skin on different parts of the body), or if the
skin just came off either by natural causes (as with Alan Anderson's
snakes) or by the creatures being, well, skinned, then the body-part plural
suffix {-Du'} may be used: {DIrDu'}. 

But {DIr} alone, without a suffix, is heard most often.
