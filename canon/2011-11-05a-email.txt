Subject: [Tlhingan-hol] EuroTalk word for "postcard"


I've just noticed something very peculiar about my copy of the Eurotalk
software while going through it again: 'echletHom is only found in the
pIqaD version. The romanised text gives it as ngeHmeH QIn nav "paper for
sending a message".

Is this the case for anyone else? (Or have I missed mention of it? I've
been away from the computer for a couple of days and come back to nearly
a hundred list messages so it's possible someone's brought it up and I
just missed reading it.)
