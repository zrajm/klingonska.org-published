> Time for the ritual post-qep'a' question:  Any new words from Okrand this year?

A cadre of grammarians had the opportunity to preview a section of a
Klingon opera. In it we noted a smattering of tlhIngan Hol spellings
for names of various places, people, and plants. Someone wrote them
down, but I did not think them important enough at the time to record
them myself. I do recall that {Suto'vo'qor} was confirmed as correct.

There were three nouns we had not seen before:

  maQ "omen, sign"
  ruS "bond", as between blood brothers
  chalqach "tower"

The first two give standalone meanings to already-existing morphemes
(see {maQmIgh} and {ruStay} in TKD). A running joke has been going for
many years about wanting a word for "deluxe apartment in the sky"; we
now know to say {chalqach pa''a'}. :)

We also saw an apparently adverbial {wa'DIch}, confirming that the
{wa'DIch jagh'e' wIHeghmoHmo'} line in {taHjaj wo'} is appropriate
usage.
