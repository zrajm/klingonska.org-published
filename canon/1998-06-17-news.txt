I was going to respond to Khaywolf's original question by asking a question
of my own in order to pin down exactly how Khaywolf wants to use the term
translated as "cleric."  Can the term be applied as broadly as the English
word "cleric," or does it refer to something more specific or specialized? 

But before I got to it, Qov managed (as usual!) to come up with some really
good suggestions. 

There may be a word for "cleric" (in some sense) we don't know yet.  I'll
wait to hear back from anyone who wants to provide clarification about what,
exactly, a Klingon cleric is/does, and then I'll check to see if there's a
good word for that.
