Star Trek III: The Search for Spock

The {tlhIngan Hol} in the movies is actually pretty good; Marc Okrand himself
coached many of the actors.

  'sub:' = Subtitles as they appear in the movie.

  'capt:' = Closed captions (following the subtitles) which was helpful in
  places where there were no subtitles.

  <...> = Indicates an uncertainty in the transcription (usually due to
  muttered dialogue, background music, sound effects or similar).

  'novel:' = Excerpts from Vonda N. McIntyre's novelization which may reflect
  an earlier version of Harve Bennett's screenplay used by the novelist in her
  adaptation.

  'trans:' = Translation (given where subtitle is missing from the movie).

time:	00:07:40 (approx.)

event:	Against a background of stars, we're slowly zooming in toward
	a small ship.

pers:	Merchant Ship Captain (Paul Sorenson)
en:	Steady. Steady, boys. Keep scanning.

pers:	Merchant Ship Captain (Paul Sorenson)
en:	I thought you people were reliable. Where the hell is he?

pers:	Valkris (Cathie Shirriff)
en:	He's been here for some time. Put me on hailing frequency.

pers:	Valkris (Cathie Shirriff)
en:	Commander Kruge. This is Valkris.

pers:	Valkris (Cathie Shirriff)
tlh:	{qa'vam De' vIje' rIntaH.}
sub:	I have purchased the Genesis data.

pers:	Valkris (Cathie Shirriff)
tlh:	{HablI' Su' labbeH.}
sub:	Ready to transmit.
novel:	"I have obtained the Federation data, and I am ready to transmit."
com:	The line as written is "Ready to transmit." The line as spoken in
	English by Ms. Shirriff was "Ready to transmit". Okrand just had to
	invent sounds to fit her mouth movements when the people who make such
	decisions decided, after the fact, to have her speaking Klingon. My
	recently concocted theory on this line is that Okrand altered the line
	to be a command to Valkris' computer (i.e. "Data transceiving-device,
	attention: prepare to transmit"), but the subtitle didn't get changed.

en:	Well done, Valkris. Well done.

pers:	Merchant Ship Captain (Paul Sorenson)
en:	What the hell is...?

pers:	Kruge (Christopher Lloyd)
tlh:	{So'wI' yIchu'Ha'!}
sub:	Disengage cloaking device!
novel:	The voice spoke a few words which only Valkris recognized, for they
	were in a Klingon language.

event:	Klingon bird of prey decloaks.

pers:	Kruge (Christopher Lloyd)
tlh:	{<...> yI<chu'>qa'}

event:	Bridge crewman pushes button and the lights come back on.

pers:	Kruge (Christopher Lloyd)
tlh:	{De' yIlI'! DaH!}
sub:	Transmit data. Now!

event:	Valkris inserts tape into her instrument panel. Kruge watches the data
	transmission on a screen.

pers:	Valkris (Cathie Shirriff)
tlh:	{jabbI'ID pItlh. Qu'vaD lI' net tu'bej.}
sub:	Transmission completed. You will find it useful.
novel:	"Transmission completed, Commander. You will find it essential to your
	mission."
com:	...this line was one of those Valkris was filmed saying in English,
	then redubbed in Klingon. Okrand had to match lip movements. The
	subtitle was something like "You'll find it useful." There was no
	mention of "for the mission" in the subtitle, but Okrand needed to add
	something to give her a reason to keep her lips moving. Note that lip
	movements for "You'll find" look a lot like {Qu'vaD}, "it" looks a lot
	like {lI'} and "useful" loosely matches {tu'bej}. /charghwI'
	     Was the Klingon line {Qu'vaD lI' 'e' Datu'bej}, but the actress
	dropped a syllable and said {qu'vaD lee' natu'bej} forcing Okrand to
	come up with {net}?

pers:	Kruge (Christopher Lloyd)
tlh:	{vaj Daleghpu'.}
sub:	Then you have seen it?
novel:	"Then you have seen the transmission?" Kruge said, implying regret and
	inevitability.

pers:	Valkris (Cathie Shirriff)
tlh:	{HISlaH, jawwI'.}
sub:	I have, my lord.
novel:	"I have, my lord," Valkris replied, granting permission in the second
	stratum and offering forgiveness as the third.

pers:	Kruge (Christopher Lloyd)
tlh:	{Do'Ha'.}
sub:	Unfortunate.
novel:	"That is unfortunate," Kruge said.

pers:	Valkris (Cathie Shirriff)
tlh:	{jIyaj.}
sub:	Understood.
novel:	"I understand," Valkris said. She made all three strata the same, for
	she wanted him to know that she understood what she was doing and why,
	that she understood what he was doing and why, and that she understood
	that he would make certain the promises made to her would be kept.

event:	Kruge resumes his position in the captains seat.

pers:	Kruge (Christopher Lloyd)
tlh:	{chuyDaH.}

pers:	Valkris (Cathie Shirriff)
tlh:	{Qapla', jawwI' bangwI' je.}
sub:	Success my lord and my love.
novel:	She spoke again, in formal tongue, to Kruge. "Success, Commander. And
	my love." She did love him, indeed, as the instrument of her
	bloodline's redemption.

pers:	Kruge (Christopher Lloyd)
tlh:	{batlh Daqawlu'taH.}
sub:	You will be remembered with honor.

event:	Bird of prey turns to approach the trader's ship again.

pers:	Kruge (Christopher Lloyd)
tlh:	{baH!}
sub:	Fire!
novel:	Then he switched dialects again. Valkris knew he was speaking so she
	would be sure to hear his command: "Fire!"

event:	The bird of prey fires. The trader's ship is hit and explodes. The bird
	of prey moves away from the debris.

event:	On the bridge Kruge rises from his seat and moves toward the bridge
	exit.

pers:	Kruge (Christopher Lloyd)
tlh:	{He chu' yIghoS. DIvI' neHmaH.}
sub:	New course. Federation neutral zone.
novel:	"Execute a course to the Federation boundary."

event:	Kruge's pet (which is lying on the floor beside the captain's seat)
	growls loudly. Kruge stops at the door.

pers:	Kruge (Christopher Lloyd)
tlh:	{yIje'!}
sub:	Feed him!
novel:	Kruge gestured casually at Warrigul. "You may have the honor of feeding
	my pet," he said.

com:	This part contains no lines in Klingon, however several of the lines
	here spoken by Klingons [in English] occurs as examples in The Klingon
	Dictionary.

pers:	Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) [on recording]
en:	To fully understand the events on which I report, it is necessary to
	review the theoretical data on the Genesis Device, as developed by
	doctors Carrol and David Marcus, Genesis, simply put, is life from
	lifelessness. It was the intention is to introduce the Genesis Device
	into preselected area of a lifeless space body, a moon or other dead
	form. The device, when delivered, would instantaneously cause the
	Genesis effect. Instead of a dead moon, a living, breathing planet now
	exists, capable of sustaining whatever life-forms we see fit to deposit
	on it.

	with the Federation, we will act for the preservation for our race. We

	Grissom is destroyed.

novel:	"I wanted prisoners," Kruge said, layering all the strata of his words
	with contempt.

	responsible for the "I told you - engine only!" / "I wanted prisoners"
	mutation. /ghunchu'wI'

	the Klingon was dubbed over later. /SuSvaj

en:	...I've come a long way for the power of Genesis, and what do I find? A
	weakly human, a Vulcan boy, and a woman.
novel:	He spoke in Standard, but his faint accent did nothing to disguise his
	impatience. "I have come a long way for the power of Genesis and what
	do I find?"

pers:	Lieutenant Saavik (Robin Curtis)
en:	My lord, we are survivors of a doomed expidition. This planet will
	destroy itself in hours. The Genesis experiment is a failure.
