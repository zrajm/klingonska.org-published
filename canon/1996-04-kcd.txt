[if I understood the Klingon word while transcribing, I put it in braces
{},  If I wasn't sure or didn't know, I marked the word with * and spelled
phonetically for later lookup.]

Gowron: "Did you think I would kill you {loDHom}? You've heard this about
Klingons. We kill anything that stands in our way. We enjoy the taste of
innocent blood. Lies. Honor is what we treasure. Honor above all things. And
you? You are as weak and frightened as a {Qa'Hom}. And there is no honor in
killing a {Qa'Hom}. But you, {nov}. You outsiders, you see only our fierceness,
our love of battle. You do not see the {tIgh} that shades our every act. [[see also: KCD book, p.10]]

Gowron: "This is why, I, Gowron, leader of the Klingon High Council have
decided to break the secrecy that shrouds our culture, and show you, {DIvI'
yoq}, that which truly makes us Klingon.

Gowron: "You are freightened young human? Yes. You should be. Your strength,
your skills are no better than that of a Klingon boy. But that will change.
When you have finished this holodeck adventure with me, this test, you will
have learned more than how to *live* as a Klingon, you will learn how to *be*
Klingon. You will no longer be {nov}, weak as a {Qa'Hom}, but you will be a
warrior.

Gowron: "Then, it will be an honor to kill you. Hahahaha.

Gowron: "Take your knife."

================================================================================

Steven Boozer's comments:

"My understanding is that Marc Okrand wasn't able to coach Robert O'Reilly
[Gowron] in person, but gave him detailed instructions on how to pronounce
everything. O'Reilly tried really hard to get it right, but he's an actor,
not a linguist. He knew what he was saying, in that he had both the English
and Klingon texts to work from, but he doesn't actually know
Klingon.  O'Reilly should be given credit: he's always done his best to be
authentic." (SuStel, 4/18/03)

"The only other person you could trust being canon and having correct
pronunciation is Gowron speaking on the Klingon Language Lab:
http://www.kli.org/wiki/index.php?Klingon%20CD

Of course he speaks "different" than Marc Okrand, but he is a different
person. Since he was trained by MO for this project, and he is really doing
a good job on this, I would say this (i.e. KCD including Gowron) really is
a canon source." (Quvar, 2/04/06)

Gowron's KCD Introductory speech (by Robert O'Reilly)

AFAIK no one has ever been able to decipher this speech. "This has
frustrated me for years. Considering how closely Okrand was involved in
producing this game, I keep feeling that Gowron's speech must actually mean
something, but whatever it is, it has eluded me. I can't go back to the
original anymore, since the game appears not to work on XP, but maybe
Quvar's transcript will be a good start." (ter'eS, 5/12,2003)

"I remember hearing that Marc Okrand wrote it and it was sent to Robert
O'Reilly, who learned it by heart and was really proud of his effort,
unaware that he completely butchered it.  I THOUGHT there was a copy of
Okrand's original text floating about..." (SuStel, 12/20/07)

"I found a bit of information about this: an interview with Robert O'Reilly
(http://tinyurl.com/393lpx):

    Q: Mr. O'Reilly--You said you did not learn Klingon--but how did you
       do the introduction sequence on Star Trek Klingon?  I_am_Klingon
  ROR: Believe it or not, they flew Marc Okrand in to be about 2 feet
       from me, not ONLY to hold my hand, but to mouth the words so that I
       would say it correctly. Some were more difficult than others and I
       had to do quite a few takes on some of them.

O'Reilly is quite the STAR TREK fan... and really, really bad at Klingon,
if Okrand had several takes and couldn't get anything better than that out
of him." (SuStel, 12/21/07)

FYI here's Quvar's transcription:

And finally here's various bits from the CD (direct quotes from the game
and Language Lab as well as second-hand information from those who've
played the game):

{qIm tera'ngan!} "Attention Earther!" (bumper sticker, c1998, included in
game box)

{'Iw 'Ip ghomey} "Blood Oath Circles" (title of a well-known sculpture by
the artist {mIStaq}. Apparently made of metal, the sculpture is a
collection of hoops of different sizes representing all the blood oaths,
complete and unfinished, as well as the circles of vengeance. It was in
Torghn's house along with other pieces of sculpture.)

{bIyem'a'} "Will you sin?"

{botjan yIchu'} "Raise shields!"

{charghbej vIt} "The truth shall conquer." Okrand adds, "In this Klingon
proverb, the suffix {-bej}, following the verb {chargh} 'conquer', means
'certainly' or 'undoubtedly'. Thus, 'there's no doubt that the truth shall
conquer.' The word for 'truth' is {vIt}, and it's also found in the word
{vItHay'}, the 'truth test'."

{Dajatlhbogh vIyajlaHbe'. yIjatlhqa'!} "I find no match for what you just
said. Please say it again." (Disk 3, files \wav\3k.wav and \wav\3e.wav)

{DenIb Qatlh} Denebian Slime Devil

{Duran lung DIr} Durani lizard skins

{ghobchuq loDnI'pu'} "The Brothers Battle One Another" (title of the
well-known Kahless and Morath statuette in Torghn's house)

{ghochwI'} "The Tracker" [title of a sculpture in Torghn's house. It is a
3D representation of the constellation {ghochwI'} which is also the name of
the constellation in the Kahless myth containing the bright star which
Boreth orbits.] KCD

{ghojmeH taj} boy's knife ("knife for learning")

{HuH} slime. "This word literally means `bile.'"

{lIghon DuQwI' pogh} Ligonian spike glove

{luq, ratlh.} "Okay, he remains."

{nuchpu'} cowards

{petaQ} a Klingon insult. "No appropriate translation for this epithet has
yet been found."

{Qa'Hom} a little animal (e.g. Ligonian titmouse) "The translation
`titmouse' is really only an approximation of what this word means. A
{Qa'Hom} is a small animal considered rather insignificant. The word
literally means 'little {Qa'}.' A {Qa'} is a larger, more dangerous animal.
A {Qa'Hom} is not a young {Qa'}, but it does bear a vague resemblance to
its namesake." (Note: the picture is of a small, four-footed rodent with a
lot of hair.)

{qeylIS mInDu'} "Eyes of Kahless" (a game)

{QI'yaH} vulgar Klingon expression. "This is one of the strongest, most foul
expressions in the Klingon language. It defies adequate translation."

{qoH} idiot, fool

{Qoy, qeylIS puqloD!} the Klingon national anthem

{reH nuHmey tu'lu'.} "There are always weapons."

{romuluSngan Sambogh 'ej HoHbogh nejwI'} Romulan hunter-killer probe (long
form); the short form is {HoHwI'}

{tu'HomI'raH} something useless: {HurDaq tu'HomI'raHvetlh yIlan} "Get that
piece of junk out of here!"

{veQ} garbage. One should enunciate this insult clearly. The KCD entry mentions
that the word {veH} "boundary" carries no negative connotations at all.

{verengan Ha'DIbaH} Ferengi dog. "This phrase literally means 'Ferengi animal,'
but translating it as 'Ferengi dog' carries more of the flavor of the insult."

{wIy yIcha'} [untranslated]

{yIntagh} a Klingon curse. "This is one of a number of Klingon curses that
doesn't have an adequate translation."

{yItamchoH} "Shut up!" (lit. "Become quiet!") When Gowron is talking with the
Pakled commander, he says this to T'Var (pronounced badly & untranslated in the
game).

================================================================================

I ignored Gowron's tlhIngan-Hol speech at the beginning since I had read
comments that it is poorly pronounced. However, after reading Voragh's
compilation, I thought it might be useful if I just transcribed the phonetic
sounds for anyone who wants to try and break the "Gowron code". :) Here's the
way his speech sounds to me: /Mike Neff <darqang99@gmail.com> [2008-01-29]

Pok's father: "Ah.. Yes. Nothing tastes as good as the beast killed in the
*junta! Ah! and here is the hunter himself, Pok, come! come! Here is the boy
who's {naQjej} brought down the largest *dignok ever to be taken down on this
planet! Yes, I'm proud to call him son. And, tomorrow, after the Rite of
Ascension, I will be prouder still to call him *warrior* son.

"To my son, who has chosen to follow the path of his grandfather's. To Pok,

Gowron: "It pleases me that I should be here at my friend Torghn's side to
watch his son become a man"

Pok's father: "Gowron, your presence brings my house honor."

Gowron: "May the house always deserve it. I have brought your son the {cha'nob}
gifts."

Gowron [to Pok]: "Honor me by taking them."

Pok's father [hand pointing to gifts]: "Pok!"

** the knife appears **

{... choose to do nothing and wait: ...}

Gowron: "Indecision! It is like a disease with you off-worlders. You think too
much. There is a Klingon saying: Act and you shall have dinner, think and you
shall *be* dinner. You understand human, take action! Try again."

{... choose to do nothing again ...}

Gowron: "Naaaahhh! Did you not understand me last time? Indecision is death!
You are still thinking like a human."

[very snarky] "Will this be the right decision, will that be the right
decision. Choose! Deal with the consequences later! But choose now! Aaaaah!"

[kindler, gentler Gowron]

"It is not your fault. Klingons learn this when they are children. If your
brother says do this, then you do it!"

[raising fists like a boxer] "...or you poise yourself for a fight. ...Or if a
woman bares her teeth at you, you hold her off, or, poise yourself... to love
her. Either way, the path is action! Go try again."

{... choose to do nothing and wait ....}

Gowron [grabbing a hold and shaking/jostling the camera/player]: "Are you sick?
Injured? Surely you can move faster than that! What is the matter, do you not
understand what is being said to you?! Try again, faster, faster,
faaassterrrr!"

{.... do nothing again .....}

Gowron [holding painstick]: "This is the last time I will tell you this. Four
times is enough even for a Pakled dog to learn. Do something!"

"I see, I cannot teach you to be Klingon using human methods, from now on I
will teach you using *Klingon* methods."

[puts painstick in his palm]

[game resets - no more Gowron scenes if you wait]

{... choose to attack Gowron's guard ....}

Pok's father [grabs camera]: "What did you do?! You would challange one of
Gowron's personal guards? They are not here for sport, they are guarding the
leader of the High Council, allied to the house of SepIch -- your house Pok --
Stop your games before someone takes true offense."

{... choose to attack Gowron ....}

Gowron [to his guard as he stops him from attacking Pok]: "*dirag! It is
alright, it was meant as a challenge of respect, isn't that right, Pok?"

Gowron [to Pok]: "My guards would be happy to die for me, and happier still to
kill for me. You are just learning, but next time you challenge me, I won't
stop them."

Torghn: "My house thanks you for all you have given us, Gowron."

Gowron: "I above all know what you give up for me, for the empire."

Torghn: "When my ancestors conqured Tanganika, and set up rule over the planets
of this sector, they did so to the service of the empire. But the empire's
needs have changed, and we must change with it."

Gowron: "Others here on Tanganika do not see things as you do my friend. The
ancient houses have ruled these planets many years, and it has brought them
great wealth. They may not be as willing as you to give up their power."

Torghn: "For the future of the empire, we must sacrifice the planet our
grandfathers conquered, and that will bring us great honor."

[Gowron and Torghn hug, guard intervenes.]

Gowron [to guard]: "Enough! Do you think Torghn would allow me to come to harm
in this house? I trust the house of SepIch to protect me. Leave! Hahhahaha!"

Gowron: "Your wife, K'Tar, looks well."

Torghn: "Yes. Do you regret that you did not take her for your wife?"

Gowron: "She has brought you great happiness. And a son. There is nothing to
regret. Hahhahah!"

Information Points
------------------

Here is information embedded as "Information Points" in the scenes up through
the ones that I have transcribed for translation.

Some thoughts:

There are three words not in my dictionary:

{Hovlat}/{Hov lat} -"Star Shrine" for "The Tracker" constellation

"*fellka/*vellka/*mellka" - a dessert dish

"*jebQa'/*jevQa" - a marriage robe hung on the wall.

Interesting that "water jug" was given in English, even though we do have
Klingon for water jug. Wonder if the Klingon came later in the production of
the game/language lab?

A lot of tapestry on the walls, but we weren't given the vocab for that form of
art in the "Argot" section of KGT.

Interesting Klingon names, like "*Seeth" with unusual vowel/consonents for
Klingon. *{SIytlh}?

The Information Points:

---

"{betleH}"

"A two-handed battle sword. The proper weapon of choice for most Klingon ritual
combat. One of three weapons traditionally displayed on the {nuH bey'}. The
weapon is deeply rooted in Klingon history beginning with Kahless's defeat of
the tyrant Molar. Though training in {betleH} begins early in a Klingon's life,
mastery is rarely reached until years after the rite of ascension."

---

"{naQjej}"

"A hunting spear weighted and balanced for throwing. Used only for the killing
of feral beast. One of three weapons traditionally displayed on the {nuH
bey'}."

--

"{ghob'etlh}"

"A gutting device used in balance with a shield when practicing the Klingon
warrior fighting style of *qIjatlh (or *qIjat). One of three weapons
traditionally displayed on the {nuH bey'}."

--

"*{Hovlat}"

"A symbolic representation of the constellation known as 'The Tracker'. The
constellation contains the star which is believed to be where Kahless was
pointing when he said 'I will be there'."

--

"Chalice of Kahless"

"Found in every warrior home. The Chalice is placed before the *{Hovlat}, where
it is always left, filled with wine, in case - the saying goes - Kahless come.
The wine is replaced every ninth day."

--

[no name given - stone tablet on wall]

"The 8 houses of power on Tanganika listed in ascending order. All homes on
Tanganika display this tablet. The house of SepIch as the most powerful house
is in the lower right hand corner. Symbol of the house of *Inqa was removed
from the tablet by *Seeth, direct ancestor to Pok and Torghn, after the start
of the SepIch-*Inqa feud."

--

[no name given - tapestry on wall]

"Striped banner with the colors of the planet Tanganika on a field of green. It
represents Tanganika's allegiance to the emperor and the empire. It has come to
symbolize the enemy for those on Tanganika that do not agree with the empire's,
and Gowron's, latest actions.

--

" *jebQa' " (or *jevQa' *jebqan )

"A large panel of embroidered cloth, taken from the ritual marriage robes worn
by the mother of the head of ..." [sound hiccups at end]

--

"{'uSu'}"

"A dish native to the original inhabitants of Tanganika. When the 8 houses
began their rule of this sector, all natives of Tanganika were banished to
outlying planets. The Klingons, however, adopted a number of their local
dishes."

---

"gagh"

"A worm-like creature native to the Klingon home world. A favorite Klingon
delicacy, rarely, if ever, eaten as a replicator dish, as it is properly served
live."

---

"Heart of Targh"

"The heart of the targh beast. Although targh are bred for food throughout the
empire, the heart of bred targ is considered weakened by domestication. Only
the heart of a wild-hunted targh is considered worthy of eating, making it a
rare delicacy."

---

"bregit lung"

"The breathing organ of any of a number of Klingon beasts, prepared in a manner
that preserves its tough texture and blanched color."

---

"rokeg blood pie"

"A much favored klingon dish. Difficult to prepare properly. There are many
regional variations of this dish. A blood feud between house of *Renghat and
house of *Dor began when warriors of each house claimed to have the better
recipe."

---

"*vellka" (or *fellka or *mellka )

"A dessert dish made from the seeds of the *peelime plant. The seeds are
fermented, crushed, and jellied."

---

"hooves of the tknag beast"

"The tknag is a dangerous carnivore native to Tanganika. The skin is tough and
leathery. The tknag is a formidable prey."

---

[no name given - tapestry on wall]

"Tapestery honoring the life and honorable death of *aygon, first head of the
house of SepIch on Tanganika. It represents the story of {qul tuq}, the famouse
opera. *aygon alone stood toe-to-toe with the largest tknag beast ever seen.
With only a d'k tagh knife he brought it down. The natives, terrified by a
warrior of such prowess, surrendered themselves wholly to *aygon. Thus alone he
began the conquest of this part of the Klingon imperial frontier."

---

[no name given - Blood Oath Circles sculpture]

"A work by the Klingon artist {mIstaq}. In it's closed and broken circles, it
is said to represent both the fulfilled and unfulfilled blood oath. It is a
warning to those who would hesitate to fulfill that which is sworn."

---

"{cha'nob} gifts"

"Presents brought by a close family ally to celebrate the coming of age of a
young man or woman. They are to be opened before the actual ritual, as they are
believed to bring the youth strength and courage. Traditionally, the gifts
include money, food, and tokens of family history."

---

[no name given - K'Tar's knife - turns out to be {SoStaj}]

"A wickedly shaped weapon, the wounds inflicted by the {SoStaj} are
particularly painful and deadly."

---

[no name given - Statue of the brothers Kahless and Morath]

"Kahless is the Klingon who brought discipline, order, and honor to the
Klingons. He is held in the highest regard. The statue represents the great
battle fought between Kahless and Morath. Although there are many versions of
this theme, this particular rendering is commonly found in cultured Klingon's
homes."

---

[no name given - large round item with {pIqaD}]

"Shield emblem of the house of SepIch. Ornamental. Smaller, practical versions
of the shield were carried into battle by House of SepIch warriors in ancient
Klingon times. The existence of a shield emblem shows that the house of SepIch
is a noble and very ancient house."

---

"Water jug"

"Traditionally kept filled and set at the front door of every warrior home. It
is said, when a warrior returns from battle, he thirsts, and should not want
for satisfaction."
