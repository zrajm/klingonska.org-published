Letters to the Editor

<Rhonda E. Green>
     This is in reference to an article by Mark Shoulson in <{HolQeD}> 3:1, p. 12.
I believe that I have discovered the Federation Standard equivalent for the
word {Hu'tegh}.  <Fuck.>  I base this on the word's usage on pages 183 and 383
of the novel <Sarek> by A. C. Crispin.  By substitution, the sentences makes
complete sense and the usage of the word in these situations mirrors its
present-day usage by American English speakers.  This makes it no longer a
mild curse, but a "biggie!"  It seems, though, that unlike our word that can
be conjugated, {Hu'tegh} seems to be able to be used without further change
in all aspects.
