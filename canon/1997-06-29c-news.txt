Actually, I tried to "pursue" the meaning of qIvon.  Maltz seemed a little
reluctant to talk about it.  (I'd say "embarrassed," but that word is
entirely inappropriate to use in describing a Klingon.)  The next time the
bloodwine is flowing freely, I'll try to remember to bring it up again. 
But I've noticed that, for me, anyway, bloodwine and memory don't mix.
