Will and David-
Guy Vardaman, the Producer here at STAR TREK: CONTINUUM, worked closely
with Marc Okrand during the creation of the Klingon Linguistic Studies
database. I have brought your concerns to his attention (since, I confess,
I know very little Klingon). He informed me he would go over the "expanded"
definitions in our database with Marc Okrand again.
