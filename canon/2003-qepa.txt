2003 -- {qep'a' wa'maHDIch}
---------------------------

MO attended. During the course of the {qep'a'} cabaret (specifically our usual
game of Klingon hokey pokey) he favored us with a newly-discovered Klingon word
[[KLI's {qep'a' wa'maHDIch} page](http://www.kli.org/stuff/qep10pic.html)].
Earthlings was filmed according to [KLI's old wiki article on the
{qep'a'mey}](https://web.archive.org/web/20110614034344/http://www.kli.org/wiki/index.php?qep%27a%27).

* {megh'an} and {'er'In} -- Pun. Okrand confirmed that this is because he knows
  two twins---his nieces---named Megan and Erin.
* {qa'rI'} "end (of a long bounded space, e.g. corridor, conduit, road, bridge,
  field etc.)" (n) -- Pun. Okrand confirmed that this is named after Kari, the
  mother of his twin nieces Megan ({megh'an}) and Erin ({'er'In}).
* {Sa'Hut} "ass, rear end, buttocks" (n) -- New word. Revealed during a session
  of singing and dancing the hokey pokey.
