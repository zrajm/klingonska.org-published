This marking represents the Klingon Empire and has been emblazoned
upon the hulls of countless Klingon Starships. During the aggressive
expansion of the Klingon people from their homeworld of Kronos into
space, this symbol grew to become as feared throughout the galaxy as
the menacing profiles of their battlecruisers.
