Hi Klingons,
after the confusion about {ghIn}, I got a chance to talk with Maltz:

-----
He said that perhaps "religious community" was not the best choice of 
words for what he intended to say.  What he meant was that while a 
{ghIn} could be a single building if that's all the monastery was, it 
could also refer to a group of buildings and accompanying grounds 
(gardens or whatever) -- the whole defined area where the members of the 
religious community live or work or do whatever they do there.  It 
doesn't mean the group of people.  Maltz hopes that helps and doesn't 
make things more confusing.
