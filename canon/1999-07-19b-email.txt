{chegh} "return" seems to work like this:

lupDujHomDaq jIchegh    "I return on the shuttle."

lupDujHom vIchegh       "I return to the shuttle."

lupDujHomDaq may'Duj vIchegh  "I return to the battle
cruiser on the shuttle"

tera'vo' Qo'noS vIchegh  "I return to Kronos from Earth"


({lupDujHom} "shuttle," {-Daq} "locative suffix," {jIchegh}
"I return" consisting of {jI-} "I" [no object] plus {chegh}
"return"; {vIchegh} "I return to" consisting of {vI-} "I
[do something to] it" plus {chegh} "return [to]"; {may'Duj}
"battle cruiser"; {tera'} "Earth," {-vo'} "from", {Qo'noS}
"Kronos")

Note that {chegh} "return" means "return to a place"; the
place being returned to is the object of the verb.  If the
place being returned to is not mentioned (as in, for
example, the first sentence above, "I return on the
shuttle"), the verb takes a prefix indicating "no object"
(here {jI-}). If the place being returned to is mentioned
(as in the final three sentences), the verb takes a
pronominal prefix that indicates the object ({vI-} in the
examples).

A different verb, {tatlh}, is used for "return" in the
sense of returning a library book or returning a weapon to
the weapons rack.

If someone were to say something like "I return the plate
to the table," the appropriate verb would be {tatlh}:

    raSDaq jengva' vItatlh

({raS} "table," {-Daq} "locative suffix," {jengva'}
"plate," {vItatlh} "I return it" consisting of {vI-} "I [do
something to] it" plus {tatlh} "return")

Though not common, it is also possible to use {tatlh} with
the reflexive suffix {-'egh} ("do something to oneself") to
convey a meaning similar to that of {chegh}:

    pa'Daq jItatlh'egh  "I return to the room"

({pa'} "room," {-Daq} "locative suffix," jItatlh'egh "I
return myself" consisting of {jI-} "I," {tatlh} "return,"
{'egh} "reflexive suffix")

The {tatlh'egh} form seems to suggest that the doer of the
action is
forcing himself/herself to do something, perhaps because it
is difficult or not desirable.
