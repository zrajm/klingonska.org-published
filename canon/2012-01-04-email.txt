Some strange annoying fact made me gotten kicked out of the list without 
letting me know. That's why I send my past messages again - sorry for 
the delay:

Both the game board and the cards show this:

{'anDor} - "Andor"
{verenganar} - "Ferenginar"

Klingon written in pIqaD.
Note that it's only one [n] in {verenganar}.

Lieven.
