Agnieszka --

Happy New Year!

It was great seeing you in Germany. I thought the qepHom was a pretty impressive
event -- lots of people, lots of interest and enthusiasm.  
[...]

So here are the four --

(1) "flavor" or "taste" (nouns) is wejwa'.

(2) "be indirect, be roundabout, be devious" is pIQHa'.  So pIQ would be 
"be direct."

(3) For "double agent," Maltz liked the slang expression jey'naS ghoqwI'  
(literally, "double-headed ax spy").  He said the non-slang term 'o'wen 
could also be used for "double agent," but its meaning is a bit broader -- 
it's used to refer to someone (or something) of ambiguous status.  As Maltz 
put it, "You're not quite sure if it's this or that. You think it's one 
thing, and it may be, but it may be another." 

(4) "hole" (like a hole in the ground) is QemjIq.  This can also be used 
for the hollow in a tree.  qung, the word for "hole in a musical instrument," 
can't be used for a hole in the ground, but it could be used for a bullet 
hole or a hole in a shirt (including buttonholes, moth holes, accidental 
rips, etc.) or a hole in the roof.  You can fill (teb) a QemjIq, but not 
a qung.

Agnieszka --

Maltz managed to come up with a few more words [...]


ditch (n) is taSman

be deep (v) is jaQ  (so "shallow" would be jaQHa'  -- but there may be another 
word for that he wasn't telling me)

be straight (v) is wan  (so "crooked" or "bent" would be wanHa')

model, example, pattern (n) is ghantoH  (Maltz is assuming this refers to 
something one copies or refers to in making things --  or something along 
those lines)

That's it so far.  I'll keep prodding.

[...]
