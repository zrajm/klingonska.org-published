  Summary: The words {Qaw'} <destroy> (n) and {jev} <storm> (v) are pointed out
    as having the wrong part-of-speech in TKD. -- Correction about {jev} is
    likely to be wrong (cf. weather words {SIS} <rain> [v], and {peD} <snow>
    [v]).

Letters to the Editor

<Christian Matzke>
     I wanted to point out two bits of {Qaghmey}.  The first is a simple error:
{Qaw'} <destroy> is listed as a noun.  Similarly, {jev} <storm> is listed as a verb.  Now
although I have heard of "storming the castle," this still seems to be an error
(with verbs like {weH}, {yov} and {HIv} this would be redundant as well).
