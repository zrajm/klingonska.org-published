A Friend of Maltz: {nItlhDu' yaDDu' je}

Marc Okrand

<Several years ago, the efforts of a
handful of preeminent scholars of
{tlhIngan Hol} was acknowledged at the
{qep'a'} by the creation of a group
named "The Friends of Maltz."
Inducion into this order bestowed a
singular benefit: the opportunity to
request of Maltz the Klingon rendering
of a specific word. Often, when the
desired term was presented to him,
Maltz has been quite generous in his
reply the linguistic community has
benefited accordingly. Maltz continues
his rather solitary lifestyle, but has
agreed to respond to the occasional
query from his friends. Here then is the
first of what we hope will be many
commentaries inspired by one of
Maltz's friends.
                                  --LMS>

A friend of Maltz recently asked
how to talk about fingers. The
friend noted, "We have the word
{nItlh}. We don't have a word for
'thumb.' Is the thumb considered to
be any different than any other
finger to a Klingon? Do Klingons
have separate words for each
finger?... In general, how do
Klingons talk about fingers if they
want to give more detail than just
the generic word?... Then, of course,
we have toes to consider..."

     Maltz replied that of course
there is a word for "thumb." In fact
there are a couple. And there are
pairs of words (nouns and verbs)
that are finger specific. The, of
course, we have the toes to consider.

     Fortunately, Maltz didn't stop
there. He elaborated.

     First of all, the word {nItlh}
"finger" means any finger, including
the thumb. A hand has {vagh
nItlhDu'} ("five fingers"), not {loS
nItlhDu'} ("four fingers") and a
thumb. There is a specific word
referring to each of the five fingers,
and these words are nouns derived
from verbs by means of the suffix
{-wI'} ("thing which does"); there are
two pairs for "thumb."

     The Federation Standard
translation of the verbs is a little
strained, but they mean something
like "use (the specific finger)." The
associated "finger nouns" would be
literally, though quite awkwardly,
"thing which is used in a thumb-like
manner" or perhaps "thing which
thumbs" or even "thumber"; "thing
which is used in an index finger-like
manner"; and so on.

     The verbs and the associated
nouns are:

{Sen}              {SenwI'}
use the thumb      thumb

{rIl}              {rIlwI'}
use the            thumb
thumb

{SIq}              {SIqwI'}
use the            index finger,
index finger       first finger

{qay}              {qaywI'}
use the            second
second finger      finger

{qew}              {qewwI'}
use the            ring finger,
ring finger        third finger

{qan}              {qanwI'}
use the            pinkie,
pinkie             little finger

     The two sets of word relating to
"thumb" are pretty much [[p.8]]
interchangeable, though small
children usually use {rIl} and {rIlwI'}
rather than {Sen} and {SenwI'}.
Similarly, adult speaking to or
about children tend to use {rIl} and
{rIlwI'}. Both words are used together
in an idiomatic expression meaning
"everybody, everyone": {SenwI'Du'
rIlwI'Du' je}, literally "thumbs and
thumbs" ({-Du'} "plural [of body
parts], {je} "and"). This expression is
often heard without the plural
suffixes: {SenwI' rIlwI' je}.

     The use of the nouns is pretty
straightforward. For example:

{qewwI'wIj DarIQmoHpu'}
you injured my ring finger
({-wIj} <my>, {Da-} <you [do something to] it>,
{rIQmoH} <injure>, {-pu'} <perfective>)

{rIQ qewwI'wIj}
my ring finger is injured
({rIQ} <be injured>)

     The "finger verbs" are used
when talking about specific ways of
using a particular device (weapon,
computer control panel, even
musical instrument) or when
describing specific ways to use
fingers (as in movements in some
martial arts). For example:

{nISwI' HIch Sen}
fire the disruptor pistol
({nISwI' HIch} <disruptor pistol>)

(literally, "use the thumb in the way
it's most appropriately used on a
disruptor pistol," "use the thumb to
activate the disruptor pistol,"
perhaps even "thumb the disruptor
pistol").

{SeHlaw SIq}
touch the control panel
with the index finger
({SeHlaw} <control panel>)

(which presumably would activate
or alter the operation of some device
or other, already known in the
conversation).

{qung wejDIch qew}
cover the third hole (in a musical
instrument) with the (tip of the)
ring finger
({qung} <hole in musical
instrument>, {wejDIch} <third>)

(and thereby alter the sound
emanating from the instrument).

     The verb {Heng} "finger holes in
a musical instrument" is a general
term. When a specific finger is being
referred to, one of the finger verbs is
usually used, though one could say
something like:

{qung wejDIch HengmeH qewwI' lo'}
(in order) to finger the third hole,
he/she uses the ring finger
({-meH} <in order to>, {lo'} <use>)

     When used with nouns with the
locative suffix {-Daq}, the finger verbs
mean "point (with a specific finger)
at or towards." For example:

{maghwI'Daq jISIq}
I point at the traitor
with my index finger

or

I point out the traitor
with my index finger
({maghwI'} <traitor>, {jI-} <I>)

{DungDaq qan}
point the little finger upwards
({Dung} <area above>)

     There are some special uses of
the reflexive forms of the finger
verbs. For example, while {ghIchwIj
vISIq} means "I touch my nose with
my index finger" ({ghIch} "nose,"
{-wIj} "my," {vI-} "I [do something to]
it") and {ghIchwIjDaq jISIq} means
"I point at my nose with my index
finger" ({-Daq} "to, at," {jI-} "I"), the [[p.9]]
phrase {ghIchwIjDaq jISIq'egh} (with
{-'egh} "oneself"), literally "I use at
myself my index finger at my nose,"
is used for "I pick my nose with my
index finger." Similarly, {nujDajDaq
rIl'egh ghu} ({nuj} "mouth," {-Daq}
"his/her", {-Daq} "at, to," {-'egh}
"oneself," {ghu} "baby"), literally "at
his/her mouth, the baby uses at
him/herself his/her thumb," is used
for "the baby sucks its thumb."

     If an implement is being used
for an activity customarily (or even
just frequently) performed by a
finger alone, a finger verb may be
used. Thus:

{maghwI'Daq SIq naQjej}
the spear points at the traitor
({maghwI'} traitor,                  [[traitor:=<traitor>]]
{-Daq} <at, to>, {naQjej} <spear>)

{maghwI'Daq SIq naQjejwIj}
my spear points at the traitor
({-wIj} <my>)

     The first of these sentences
could be translated loosely as
"He/she point at the traitor with
his/her spear" and the second could
be "I point at the traitor with my
spear" even though, in both cases,
the spear, not the spear carrier or
spear owner, is the pointer. If the
owner of the spear is not the user of
the spear at the time of the
utterance, the sentence must be
more complex:

{maghwI'Daq SIqmeH
naQjejwIj lo' SuvwI'}
the warrior uses my spear
to point at the traitor
({-meH} <in order to>, {lo'} <use>,
{SuvwI'} <warrior>)

This could be translated as "the
warrior points at the traitor with my
spear."

     A couple of the finger verbs may
be related to other verbs is the
language (though it's possible that
the resemblance is coincidental
rather than etymological).

     In addition to {qan} "use the little
finger, use the pinkie," there is
another verb {qan} meaning "be old
(not young)." No doubt because of
this resemblance, when one points
at someone using the little finger, or
when one remarks on this pointing,
the pointer is making a comment on
the age of the person being pointed
to. Thus

{qI'empeqDaq jIqan}

is literally "I point at K'mpec with
my little finger," but idiomatically it
means "(I think that) K'mpec is old"
({qI'empeq} "K'mpec," {-Daq} "to, at,"
{jI-} "I"). Compare [[Compare:=Compare:]]

{qan qI'empeq}
K'mpec is old

Klingons are always direct, but there
is more than one way to be direct.

     The second finger verb for
"thumb," {rIl}, is phonetically
identical to a verb associated with
music: {rIl} "play (a wind
instrument)." The semantically
similar verb {SuS}, which means
"blow (into a wind instrument)," is a
general term which is applied to all
wind instruments. {rIl}, on the other
hand, is restricted to the {gheb} (for
better of worse, usually translated
"horn"), no doubt because the
playing technique is different from
that employed with other wind
instruments. While one blows into
the large, complex instrument
known as a {meSchuS}, for example,
one does something more involved
to get noise out of a {gheb}, though
Maltz was unable to describe the
action very well. Perhaps for
expediency, Maltz translated {SuS} as [[p.10]]
"he/she blows" and {rIl} as "he/she
horns," knowing full well that "to
horn" does not have this meaning
in standard Federation Standard. It is
not clear how {rIl} "use the thumb"
may be related to the verb {rIl}
"horn," but if it is, it may be
connected somehow to the fact that
{rIl} "use the thumb" is the word used
when referring to babies sucking
their thumbs (see above). Perhaps
there is a similarity in technique.

     Then, of course, we have toes to
consider.

     As with the fingers, there are
pairs of toe words, working in a
parallel manner. A foot has {vagh
yaDDu'} "five toes," an each toe has
two words, a noun and a verb,
associated with it. Klingon toes hove
more dexterity than human toes,
though not as much a Klingon or
human fingers. To a degree
surprising to humans, Klingons can
control each toe independently.

     The verbs an associated nouns
are:

{mar}              {marwI'}
use the            big toe
big toe

{Hom}              {HomwI'}
use the            second
second toe         toe

{roS}              {roSwI'}
use the            third
third toe          toe

{nan}              {nanwI'}
use the            fourth
fourth toe         toe

{Qay'}             {Qay'wI'}
use the            little
little toe         toe

     The verbs are used in the same
way the finger verbs are used,
though, except for when talking
about martial arts movements and
certain positions in Klingon classical
ballet (never performed with shoes
or boots), the verbs are not heard
very often and are, in fact,
considered archaic.

     Nevertheless, some examples are
(see more complete explanations
above in the discussion of finger
verbs):

{rav Qay'}
touch the floor with the little toe
({rav} <floor>)

{DungDaq Hom}
point upwards with the second toe
({Dung} <area above>, {-Daq} <at, to>)

{nujDajDaq mar'egh ghu}
the baby sucks its big toe
({nuj} <mouth>, {-Daj} <his/her>, {-Daq} <at, to>,
{-'egh} <oneself>, {ghu} <baby>)

(literally, "at his/her mouth, the
baby uses at him/herself his/her big
toe).                                  [[toe:=toe"]]

     There are a number of words
similar to the toe verbs. As with the
finger verbs, these words may or
may not be etymologically
connected. {roS} "use the third toe" is
phonetically identical to {roS} "lick"
as well as the {roS} found in
{roSHa'moH} "paralyze." The verb for
"paralyze" consists of three
elements: the verb {roS} (of unclear
meaning), {-Ha'} "undo," {-moH}
"cause." Thus it may be literally
translated as "cause to no longer
{roS}" or "cause to un-{roS}" or the like.
A verb {roS} having anything to do
with general mobility does not occur
except in {roSHa'moH}. If the toe
verb {roS} is the same verb, "paralyze"
means "cause to not use the third
toe." Perhaps mobility of the third
toe was associated somehow with [[p.11]]
mobility in general. Indeed, there is
an idiomatic expression {pe'vIl roS}
"he/she uses his/her third toe
forcefully" ({pe'vIl} "forcefully")
which conveys the idea that he or
she is particularly agile or nimble or
spry. On the other hand, maybe the
motions of the Klingon third toe
look like a tongue licking.

     There is a joke, Maltz recalled,
about someone trying to lick some
food off of a stirring stick while
wearing shoes. Maltz laughed, but
didn't tell the joke.

     The verbs {nan} "use the fourth
toe" and {nan} "gouge" are probably
etymologically related, since {nan} is
used to refer to a particularly
effective martial arts kick. Similarly,
the phonetic identity of {Qay'} "use
the little toe" and {Qay'} "blow one's
top, lose one's temper" is probably
not accidental, as evidenced by the
idiomatic expression {'oy'qu'
Qay'wI'wIj}, literally "my little toe
aches a lot" ({'oy'} "ache, hurt," {-qu'}
"emphatic," {-wIj} "my"), which
means "I'm <extremely> angry."

     The connection between {Hom}
"use the second toe" and {Hom}
"bone" is probably through the
slang meaning of the noun {Hom},
namely "weakling," This has been
associated with the diminutive
suffix {Hom}, and there is no doubt
that the existence of the suffix
reinforces the slang interpretation.
Nevertheless, there is also a link to
toes. Pointing one's second toe at
someone (typically an opponent or
an enemy) with the other toes
pointing downward is considered an
insulting gesture. One is calling the
opponent unworthy -- a "weakling."
The phrase {jaghwI'Daq jIHom},
literally "I use (my) second toe at my
enemy" ({jagh} "enemy," {-wI'} "my,"
{-Daq} "at, to," {jI-} "I") would most
likely be interpreted as "I claim my
enemy is unworthy or weak," even if
not accompanied by the actual
movement of the toe. The gesture
itself is most likely to come up
during ritualized martial arts combat
(which, incidentally, is often a part
of Klingon ballet).

     Maltz said there was more that
could be said about finger and toes,
but that anything else would have to
be put off for another time. As he
left, however, he said, {vaDjaj
yaDDu'lIj} "may your toes be
flexible" ({vaD} "be flexible," {-jaj}
"may," {yaD} "toe," {-Du'} "plural," {-lIj}
"your"), apparently a wish for good
fortune, or something of the sort. At
least one hopes that what it is.
