More From Maltz

In the course of discussing the
imminent release of the Klingon
translation of Gilgamesh with Maltz,
a minor mystery was cleared up. In
the epic, Gilgamesh and Enkidu
battle the Bull of Heaven. The
Klingon translation (allegedly found
on a barren planetoid) contains the
phrase:

{QI'tu' tangqa'}

Although {QI'tu'} <heaven> is a familiar
enough term, {tangqa'} is clearly
something new. Maltz graciously
provided the following brief
explanation:

There's this Klingon animal, you see,
which is kind of bull-like.

It's called a {tangqa'}.

Both male and female ones are
called {qangqa'}. So it doesn't really
mean "bull." But it certainly looks
like one. Or more like a bull than
anything else.
