Subject: [Tlhingan-hol] Eurotalk - New Words - Countries

On September 30th, Eurotalk released their first Klingon language software.
It was decided that we should wait 30 days before releasing new words
in bulk form on this list.

However there have been several of the new words used on various other
places on the internet such as facebook and twitter.

It just so happens, that Eurotalk started shipping physical CD-ROMs
before the 30th, to allow pre-orders to arrive on release day.

Some of those CD's arrived on the 29th. A day early.

Which makes today 30 days.

I've decided to go ahead and post the country names.
Not the most exciting part, but it is a day early.

Australia - 'aSralya'
Canada - qa'naDa'
China - jungwoq
Denmark - Denmargh

And there you have it folks.

Any suggestions on how to transliterate "Scotland" and "Ireland" based
on the countries above?
Those are my children's names.
