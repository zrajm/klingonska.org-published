Do we know this is a noun?  (Is it listed and labeled in KGT?)  Could it be 
a quality?  Or a homophonous noun/verb pair?

Two unverified examples from canon:

   chach!
   [Emergency!] ST6 (untranslated)

   tlham chach chu'qa'
   Restoring auxiliary gravity. ST6 (clipped?)

If I heard this correctly, {chach} appears to be acting as a quality here: 
"backup/auxiliary gravity".  If it's a noun, I would expect the noun+noun 
phrase ?{chach tlham} "emergency gravity".

Related noun:  ghuH "alert"
