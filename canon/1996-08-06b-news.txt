Lisa --
You are right, of course.  The Klingon word for "growl" isn't in the 
dictionary.  Likewise "jealous." That doesn't mean that these words don't 
exist -- we just haven't learned them yet.  In the meantime, I think the best 
approach is to follow the advice of d'Armond Speers (in his response to your 
note) and use what we do know in creative ways.

Let us know what you come up with!

PS -- The Klingon word for "smile" is mon.  This also means things like 
"snarl" and "smirk." I wouldn't be surprised to find a Klingon mon and growl 
at the same time, but mon by itself doesn't describe the full growling 
experience.
