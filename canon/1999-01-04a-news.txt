No reason for me to add anything here!  This is a good 
illustration of the use of the verb <rur> "resemble." 

The word <rur> also comes up a lot in Klingon similes, such
as <'up; yIH rur> "(it's) disgusting as a tribble,"
literally "it's disgusting; it resembles a tribble" (<'up>
"it is disgusting," <yIH> "tribble," <rur> "it resembles
[it]").
