Subject: [Tlhingan-hol] new word

Marc Okrand gave us one new word, which was revealed at the qepHom last 
weekend:
------------
Maltz said that the primitive computer systems used by Terrans are very 
different from the superior systems used by Klingons, but there is some 
overlap.  He was going to give this more thought also, but he did say 
that the closest thing to "World Wide Web" is {weQmoQnaQ}.
------------

I asked Marc Okrand - just to be sure - if this is the same as the 
internet, or if we could even call that *'Internet*, and this was his 
answer:

-----
I checked with Maltz.

He's fuzzy about Terran computer technology and computer terms, but he 
said that {weQmoQnaQ} is not the same thing as the Internet.  He said, 
if he understands correctly, you can do many more things with the 
Internet than just dealing with the {weQmoQnaQ}.  But he stopped there, 
so I'll have to bother him again to find out about these other things.

I also asked him about the word *'Internet*.  He said he thought that it 
was pretty funny that Terrans use that word.  He laughed a little bit, 
as if there were some sort of a joke.  But he didn't elaborate.  I guess 
that's for another time.
-----

Does anyone see the pun? It took me some time, but I'm not a native 
english speaker.
