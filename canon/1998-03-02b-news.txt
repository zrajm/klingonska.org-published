The short answer is that we *can* have QochHa', it's just not listed in the
Dictionary.  As I wrote elsewhere (in the old MSN newsgroup, but repeated
in another thread in this newsgroup), for the most part, words in The
Klingon Dictionary consisting of verb + suffix are there as a matter of
convenience.  That is, if you want to look up how to say "misinterpret,"
it's there -- {yajHa'}.  {yajHa'} consists of {yaj} "understand" plus the
negative suffix {-Ha'} "undo," and, even though {yajHa'} is an entry in the
Dictionary, there is nothing to prevent other suffixes, including the other
negative suffix {-be'}, from following {yaj}.  Thus {yajbe'} is a perfectly
well-formed word meaning "not understand." 

Because there is a meaning difference between the two negative suffixes
(for sake of brevity, {-Ha'} suggests doing or being something in the wrong
way or undoing something; {-be'} suggests simply not doing or not being
something), there is a meaning difference between {yajbe'} and {yajHa'}. 
The first word implies the absence of understanding ("not understand"); the
second implies that any understanding that there may have been was
imprecise or askew or not properly done ("misunderstand, misinterpret"). 

Which brings us to {Qochbe'} and {QochHa'}.  Both consist of the verb
{Qoch} "disagree" plus a negative suffix.  Parallel to the example above
with {yaj} "understand,"  {Qochbe'} implies an absence of disagreeing
(hence "agree"); {QochHa'} implies that any disagreeing was misplaced or
misconstrued or perhaps has been "undone."  English lacks a simple way to
say this.  (At least I couldn't think of one; if anyone has any
suggestions, I'd be interested in seeing them.)  Made-up words like
"misdisagree" or "undisagree" may get the idea across, but they're hardly
elegant (unlike Klingon {QochHa'}, which is elegance itself). 

Now this raises another question, slightly different from the original one:
If both {Qochbe'} and {QochHa'} are acceptable Klingon words, why is one in
the Dictionary and the other not?  For better or worse, the Dictionary is a
"one size fits all" sort of work.  It's for those who want to study the
language in depth (though it is far from exhaustive), but also for those
who want a quick reference (How do you say "agree"?).  Since "agree" (that
is, "not disagree") is probably going to be said more frequently that
"misdisagree" (or a more felicitous equivalent), it got to be listed. 
Similarly, {naDHa'} "discommend" is listed due to its importance in Klingon
culture, though {naDbe'} "not commend" is a properly formed word.
