1997 -- {qep'a' loSDIch}
------------------------
MO attended, according to [KLI's old wiki article on the
{qep'a'mey}](https://web.archive.org/web/20110614034344/http://www.kli.org/wiki/index.php?qep%27a%27).

"As a special treat Marc provided the grand prize in our linguistic
competition, a brand new word." [[KLI's {qep'a' loSDIch}
page](http://www.kli.org/stuff/qep4pic.html)].

* {mIQ} "deep fry" -- Pun. Is as in "{mIQ}-Donald's french fries" (Robyn
  Stewart)
* {nay} "marry (wife does this)" and {Saw} "marry (husband does this)" -- Marc
  Okrand verified that this comes from "nay" (no) and "sure" with a Southern
  drawl. (Chet Braun)
* {neHmaH} "neutral zone" (n) -- Pun. "Krankor's favorite word (he told me so)
  is {neHmaH} 'neutral zone' because when separated into two words {neH maH}
  means 'We want it.' Yes it is cute but Okrand did not intentionally do it."
  (Chet Braun)
* {vegh} "go through (an open door, a tunnel, etc.)" (v) -- New word.
* {'ul} "electricity" (n) -- Pun. Okrand confirmed the suspicion of a list
  member about its origin: electronic goods sold in the United States have a
  sticker on them saying UL ("Underwriter's Laboratory") showing they meet
  industry safety standards. (Robyn Stewart)
