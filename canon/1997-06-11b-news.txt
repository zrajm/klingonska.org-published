Before tackling your question, we'll need a little more information about
the meanings you're looking for.  For example, is "rebel" (the English
word) a noun or a verb?  Likewise for the other two words.  And, if
"confederate" is a noun, do you mean something more like "ally" or more
like "accomplice"?

Maybe using the words in sentences would help clarify the meanings you
intend.

Once you've specified what you need, I hope others contribute their ideas
for translations also.
