Qermaq's suggestion to use the verb <tlhej> "accompany" as
a way to get across the notion of "with" in the sentence
meaning "he went with them" is exactly right.

Its use is not restricted to the notion of going someplace
("accompany" in the sense of "go with").  It is fine to say
such things as:

    'Iw HIq vItlhutlh.  mutlhej ghaH.

"He/she drinks bloodwine with me," literally "I drink
bloodwine.  He/she accompanies me" (<'Iw HIq> "bloodwine,"
<vItlhutlh> "I drink it," <mutlhej> "he/she/they
accompanies/accompany me," <ghaH> "he, she").
