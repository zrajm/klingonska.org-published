Hi,

Rather accidentally, I found a word I had not seen before. The publisher 
of the new *paq'batlh* has a company with no name. The name is just 
"publisher" in every language. Including Klingon :-)

The publisher was so kind to pass me a line he received from Marc Okrand:

<<<<<<<<<<<<<
the Klingon phrase for "publishing house" is Se'vIr malja'. Se'vIr is a 
publication of any kind (print or otherwise); it's a new word. malja' 
means "business."
<<<<<<<<<<<<<

You can see it on the bottom of the website for paq'batlh:

Quvar valer
