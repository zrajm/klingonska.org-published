In this commercial Klingon commander Gowron (as seen in <Star Trek: The Next
Generation>) rewards his officers for victory in battle by giving them a gift
-- a Klingon Bird-of-Prey Christmas ornament. Gowron is played by Robert
O'Reilly, Crewman 1 by Guy Vardaman.

Gowron: {Qapla'}
<Greetings!>

Gowron: {pIj maSuvpu' batlh maSuvpu' 'ej maQapbejta'}
<In our many battles, we have fought with honor and achieved... victory!>

Gowron: {vaj malopmeH tlhIHvaD nob SaSuqpu'}
<So to celebrate, I've gotten you all a gift.>

Gowron: {tlhIngan toQDujHom 'oH}
<It's a Klingon Bird-of-Prey ornament.>

Crewman 1: {toQDujna' rurchu'}
<It looks so real!>

Crewman 2: {Qapqu' wovmoHbogh janHommey}
<It even has working lights!>

Crewman 1: ({peghmo' ... }) [[??]]
<That was real nice of him.>

Crewman 2: {HIja' <gibberish> wISuqnIS} [[??]]
<Yeah, we should get him a thank you card.>

The last two lines are badly garbled. Whatever gibberish Crewman 2 is saying,
from the verb prefix {wI-} it should be a singular object noun, probably formed
from the verb {tlho'} <thank> or the noun {tlho'} <appreciation, gratitude> --
*{tlho'meH nav/ghItlh} <thank you card>?

"The commercial switches to Federation Standard displaying the ship and giving
the sales pitch. After that we see the warriors speaking to one another as they
leave through the door. [This scene seems to follow the rule: 'If you can't
remember your lines, mumble a lot.' We can only surmise that Dr. Okrand gave
them some legitimate lines and they chose to fake it instead.]" (Glen Proechel)

Marc Okrand commented on the old MSN BBS (6/18/1997):
"I haven't seen the commercial in a while, but I don't think {wov} was used as
a noun there. Though the Klingons in the ad may have ad libbed a bit, the
phrase the one Klingon was supposed to say regarding the little lights in the
Bird of Prey ornament was {wovmoHbogh janHommey}. That is, 'little devices that
cause (something) to be light or bright' or 'little devices that brighten
(something)' or 'little devices that light (something) up' or the like. {wov}
is a verb 'be light, bright' followed by the suffix {-moH} 'cause' (thus,
'cause to be light')."
