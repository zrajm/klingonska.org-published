Everyday Klingon

We've seen a number of Klingon
trading cards over the years,
and a new one has recently come to
light on the KLI's discussion mailing
list. Decipher, Inc., makers of several
collectible card games include a card
in their <Star Trek: Fajo
Collection> series labeled {Qapla'},
which in the terms of the game's
rules is an "interrupter" card and is
appropriately labeled {qaghwI'}. The
Klingon text is limited to some
familiar epigrams:

    {DabuQlu'DI' yISuv.
    bISovbejbe'DI' tImer.
    Suvlu'taHvIS yapbe' HoS neH.
    tIqDaq HoSna' tu'lu'.
    may'meyDajvo' Haw'be' tlhIngan.}

and also instructions for card use:

    {DuHIvchugh ghol vaj qaStaHvIS
    may'vetlh HoSDaq ghob luchel
    quv ghajbogh tlhInganpu'lI'. (vI'be'.)}

    Can we expect to see more?
