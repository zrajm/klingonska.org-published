I'm glad you (and your friends) are enjoying the Klingon CD.  And thanks
to others who responded (more quickly than I!) to this posting and listed
the various books and tapes available. 

Having said that, I'm not sure which CD you've got! 

There are (to the best of my knowledge) two or three Klingon language CDs,
depending on how you count: 

Disk 3 of the three-disk CD-ROM set "Star Trek: Klingon"  contains the
Klingon Language Lab (CD-ROM) and also a portion of "Power Klingon" (which
can be played as a regular audio CD), available in its full form on
audiocassette.  (So this can count as either one or two CDs.) 

There is also a CD version of "Conversational Klingon"  (originally
produced as an audiocassette) that was distributed in the "Emissary Gift
Set" several years ago.  I don't know if it's available separately.  This
gift set also contained the Next Generation "Interactive Technical Manual"
(CD-ROM), a preview version of the CD-ROM game "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine
Harbinger," and a videotape of the pilot episode of DS9, "Emissary." 

If there was a Klingon language CD of some kind included in the Omnipedia
gift set, I don't know what it was, though I'd love to find out! 

As for additional CDs -- as of now, I've got nothing in the works, but as
long as there are people interested in learning more Klingon.....
