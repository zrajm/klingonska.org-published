Notes from <Star Trek V: The Final Frontier>

Inside the commercially available
script for <Star Trek V: The Final
Frontier> you won't find much
Klingon. The lines designated to be
spoken in Klingon appear,
parenthetically, in English. During
the making of the film Marc Okrand
created notes and tapes for the
Klingon actors to work from in
preparing their lines. Some samples
of these appear below; the scene
number refers to the version of the
script in use when the actors were
given the Klingon material, and does
not precisely correspond to the
numbering of the final script.

Scene 32
    This portion of the scene in
which the alien ambassadors meet
was apparently cut from the final
film. It's unclear from materials at
hand if Korrd's lines were to be
subtitled in English or not.
