  FIXME Placeholder for {veS QonoS} issue, with list of new words
  [http://klingonska.org/canon/1992-09-holqed-01-3.txt]

  The below transcript is just cut-and-pasted out of HolQeD-01-3. It is not
  verified in any special way, as Klingonska Akademien does not have this issue
  of {veS QonoS} in its archive (yet!).
