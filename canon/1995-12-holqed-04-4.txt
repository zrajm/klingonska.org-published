1. Groups

     Some additional information has come to light regarding words relating
to groups or assemblies. Among those words already well-known for
difterent types of groups are:

{boq} "alliance" (also "bloc" or "coalition," though "coalition" is sometimes
{boq ru'}, literally "temporary alliance")

{DIvI'} "federation" or "organization" (also "association," "league," "union")

{ghom} "group" or "party" (also "band," in the nonmusical sense)

{qev} (also {ghom'a'}) "crowd"

Add to this list:

{tlhach} "faction" or "sect"

     There are also a few more words related to schools or academic pursuits.
The most general word for "school" (a place for learning) is {DuSaQ} A
Specialized school, perhaps translatable as "academy," is {'ampaS}. An
organization dedicated to scholastic pursuits or research is a {yejHaD}
"institute" or "institution" or a {yej'an} "society." The distinction between
{yejHaD} and {yej'an} is not clear, though the former is usually -- but not
always -- used for larger organizations. It is not known whether the first
syllable of these words ({yej}) is {yej} "council, assembly," but there could be
some historic connection. Note that {nugh} "society" has a much broader
meaning: a group of people with a shared culture. Accordingly, {tlhIngan
nugh} would mean "Klingon society" as distinguished from, say, Romulan
society, but {tlhIngan yej'an} would probably be "the Klingon Society," a
group dedicated to the study of Klingons.

2. Negative Adverbials?

     The word for "dishonorably" is {batlhHa'}. This is clearly the adverbial
{batlh} "in an honored fashion" plus a suffix {-Ha'}, which might be analyzed
as the negative suffix that follows verbs or else as a suffix identical in form
(and meaning?) to it, but which appears with adverbials.

     Whether this {-Ha'} can he added to all adverbials is not clear. The notes
taken while working with Maltz indicate that he balked at {vajHa'} ("not
thus") but accepted {Do'Ha'} "unfortunately." Information on other
adverbials has not yet been uncovered, though it is probably in the notes
somewhere.
