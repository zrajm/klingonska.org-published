INTRODUCTION

After years marked by increased cooperation, mutual
understanding, and sharing of knowledge, a pro-
tracted period of relative amity between the Klingon
Empire and the United Federation of Planets came to an
abrupt end not long ago when the Empire withdrew from
the peace treaty known as the Khitomer Accords over an
incident regarding war with the Cardassian Union. Ironi-
cally, that same war has brought the two governments
back together. Though he did so with some trepidation,
Klingon Chancellor Gowron recently agreed to once
again honor the accords and to engage in joint missions
with the Federation. These missions have been success-
ful, and as a result, both commerce and intellectual ex-
change are slowly returning to the levels that had been
attained prior to the hostilities. Many feel that the time
is right for travelers to once again visit various parts of
the Klingon Empire.
     As those who have visited the Klingon Empire in the
past can attest, Klingons are an exuberant people, savor-
ing all life has to offer. Travel to any part of the Empire
offers the potential of a large number of truly invigorat-
ing experiences. On the other hand, since the Klingon
inclination toward activity as opposed to passivity often
is interpreted (not always incorrectly) as aggression or
belligerence, one needs to be in a position to understand [[p.2]]
everything that one is likely to encounter in order to be
able to participate fully in all activities as well as to avoid
accidentally putting oneself in a humiliating if not life- [[keep hyphen]]
threatening situation.
     The first step toward understanding the people of an-
other culture is learning their language. Certainly the
central part of any language is its pronunciation, gram-
mar, and vocabulary. In the case of Klingon, reference
materials and courses on the language have been avail-
able for some time and, though much remains to be dis-
covered, a traveler can, with a reasonable amount of
expedience, learn the basics. Unfortunately, the basics
are just that---the basics. Typically, students of the Klin-
gon language who, after several years of study, visit the
Klingon Homeworld or some other part of the Empire
find that their efforts have prepared them only partially
for what they actually encounter. They hear words they
have not heard before and expressions that do not make
any sense even though each word is familiar. They find
some speakers easy to understand, but others seem to be
pronouncing words most peculiarly or speaking a lan-
guage that resembles Klingon only vaguely. They hear
grammatical patterns their textbooks and teachers told
them never occur, clear violations of the rules.
     The Klingons they are meeting are not making up vo-
cabulary, pronouncing words in a capricious fashion, or
blithely ignoring the rules of grammar, however. What is
going on is that most introductory courses in Klingon
and most phrase books prepared for recreational travel-
ers either fail to mention or mention only in passing the
various ways the language is used within the Empire, the
way it varies depending on social criteria. Of course
using a language involves choosing appropriate vo-
cabulary and following the rules of pronunciation and
grammar, but the particular way language is used---the
particular words chosen and the particular constructions
employed---is determined partly by the meaning that the
speaker wants to convey, but also partly by who the [[p.3]]
speaker is, the speaker's relationship to the addressee,
the type of information being imparted, and the locale of
the conversation or nature of the occasion during which
it is taking place. A Klingon captain may speak one way
when giving commands to his or her crew, another when
speaking to a spouse or child, and another when engaged
in verbal (or even physical) jousting at a bar.
     In addition, introductory works on Klingon usually
ignore the diversity within the Klingon Empire. This
oversight is not surprising, since even the most well-in-
formed members of the Federation often think of Klin-
gons as a rather homogeneous group. Indeed, Jadzia
Dax, science officer on space station Deep Space 9, was
in a position to point out to a group of her fellow officers
that "Klingons are as diverse a people as any other." She
understood this because the Trill's previous host, Curzon
Dax, had spent a great deal of time among, and was well
admired by, the Klingons and had acquired a great deal
of knowledge of their culture.
     The diversity found in the Klingon Empire is to be
expected because over the centuries, Klingons have con-
quered many worlds representing a variety of languages
and cultures. Even ignoring the impact that absorbing
these originally alien cultures has had, there remains va-
riety within the Empire. There are the differences of age,
of class, of region, and of participation in specialized ac-
tivities. All of these differences are reflected in the way
the people speak. In addition, there are occasions where
strict adherence to grammatical rules and use of the
most traditional vocabulary is appropriate, and other oc-
casions where a somewhat different set of rules applies
and newer words and expressions are used. There are
even occasions, particularly during some rituals, requir-
ing the use of ancient forms of the language.
     Just as important as the existence of these differ-
ences is the fact that all members of Klingon society are
aware of and make use of the differences. By the way a
Klingon speaks, another Klingon may be able to tell what [[p.4]]
part of the Empire the speaker grew up in, whether the
speaker is a member of a higher or lower class, the rela-
tive age of the speaker, and, depending on the topic of
conversation, perhaps the occupation of the speaker. In
the same way, a Klingon, though not predisposed to de-
ception, may, if necessary or potentially beneficial, dis-
guise his or her identity by imitating the speech of a
member of another group.
     Visitors to Klingon communities are also often ill
prepared for more than superficial discussions simply
because they lack the vocabulary. As in other societies,
those Klingons dealing with any area of specialization,
whether military skills, food preparation, or the arts, em-
ploy special words not normally used in general conver-
sation. Furthermore, there are terms and grammatical
formations used in only very special situations, and using
them elsewhere is at the very least embarrassing and
could be quite offensive.
     Klingons take their language very seriously, and this
includes not only the vocabulary and grammar but also
the rules of usage. Just as a traveler who behaves in an
abnormal way is an object of suspicion and probably not
to be trusted, a traveler who speaks inappropriately---
even if the words and grammar are, strictly speaking,
correct---is sure to encounter disapproval, if not rejection
or even retribution. It is against this background that this
guide, <Klingon for the Galactic Traveler,> has been pre-
pared. It is not a typical guidebook for tourists. No res-
taurant or hotel recommendations are made, nor is
information about required travel documentation pro-
vided. Its focus is more narrow: a guide to language
usage to help galactic travelers who already have at least
a fair knowledge of the language get along with their
Klingon hosts and get the most out of their visits. Though
prepared by a staff of Federation researchers and written
with a bias toward Federation Standard (that is, the lan-
guage in use throughout the United Federation of Planets
and, for interplanetary communication, in most parts of
the Alpha and to some degree other quadrants), much [[p.5]]
of the information in this book should prove useful to
travelers from other parts of the galaxy as well.
     Even if one has no prior knowledge of the Klingon
language, it should be possible to learn a great deal about
Klingons from this book. It will be most useful, however,
if the reader has familiarity with, or at least a nearby
copy of, a work known as <The Klingon Dictionary,> which
was prepared under the auspices of Federation Scientific
Research Council a number of years ago. In particular,
the spelling conventions used for Klingon words are ex-
plained there, as are descriptions of Klingon sounds. Ex-
cept when needed to clarify a point, this information is
not repeated here. Details of Klingon grammar, on the
other hand, are explained as necessary in the discussions
that follow, but comparing the descriptions here with
those in the dictionary will make the specifics of the lin-
guistic diversity more apparent. At the end of this vol-
ume, there is an addendum to the dictionary, a listing of
words not known or whose accuracy was not confirmed
at the time of the publication of that work.
     It is understood that written explanations of spoken
phenomena are inadequate for a full understanding of the
topic. What is here is only a guide, a sampling, and it can
in no way replace the knowledge and experience acquired
by actually living among Klingons. It should be, however,
an essential first step. By way of disclaimer, it should be
pointed out that although every effort has been made to
be accurate, the compilers of this work cannot be respon-
sible for the behavior of Klingons who may disagree.
     Once again, the Scientific Research Council has been
most generous in its support of this ongoing research. Ad-
ditional funding was graciously provided by the Galactic
Society of Travel. A staff of Klingon consultants and Feder-
ation scholars contributed a great deal of time compiling
and interpreting the data upon which the analyses in this
book are based. In particular, the efforts of one Klingon
contributor are to be singled out for commendation.

THE FICTION OF KLINGON
CONFORMITY

All Klingons are not alike. To an outsider, Klingon
society is often regarded as rather homogeneous, as
if all Klingons behave and think in the same way. In fact,
although there are a good many shared basic beliefs and
understandings that hold Klingon society together and
define what it means to be a Klingon, there is a great
deal of variation. Thus, despite the veneration shown to
warriors, not everyone is a warrior. Some houses (that is,
lineages) are more wealthy and powerful than others.
The behavior patterns of Klingon men and women are
hardly indistinguishable. Some Klingons may prefer one
type of music or poetry; other Klingons, another. Older
and younger Klingons find a great many areas of behav-
ior about which they disagree.
     By the same token, all Klingons do not speak alike.
Some of the differences in Klingon speech are relatively
trivial: rate or cadence of speech, for example, or a slight
difference in the pronunciation of a specific sound. These
kinds of differences, in addition to the specific audio
qualities (pitch and so forth) of an individual's voice,
make it possible to distinguish one speaker from another.
On the other hand, some differences may be rather
significant: choice of words, major differences in pronun-
ciation, use (or avoidance) of certain grammatical con-
structions. Frequently, these differences mark one's place [[p.8]]
within the society. Some linguistic traits are associated
with the region in which one was raised, some with age,
others with levels of education or expertise in certain
areas, and still others with politics.
     If there are too many of these differences, intelligibil-
ity could be affected. That is, two people speaking in two
extremely different ways will not be able to understand
one another. This is, of course, the case when two people
are speaking two different languages---with utterly dif-
ferent sounds, grammar, and vocabulary---each un-
known to the other speaker. There are times, however,
even when the same language is spoken, that some differ-
ences lead to a certain amount of intelligibility. [[intelligibility:=unintelligibility]]
     The current linguistic situation in the Klingon Em-
pire is a rather complex one that can be somewhat better
understood in the light of a bit of history. Klingon my-
thology holds that over 1,500 years ago, Kahless the Un-
forgettable actually created the Klingon Empire by
overthrowing the tyrant Molor. Kahless gave the people
laws of honor and strength and also set the tone for what
was long considered, perhaps unjustly, the Klingon pat-
tern of conquering other worlds by force and ruling them
oppressively. Before Kahless united them, however, the
peoples of Kronos, the Klingon Homeworld, consisted of
disparate groups (despite Molor's unpopular rule over all
of them), with different customs and sometimes different
languages. As the Empire expanded, as other planets
were---depending on one's point of view---conquered or
incorporated, an even greater number of distinct cultures
and languages became part of the overall mix.
     Though the peoples of the Empire, except those most
recently involuntarily included, have become somewhat
more homogeneous as time has gone on, traces---some
subtle, some obvious---of their separate histories remain.
In terms of language, there are regions within the Empire
where the ancestral languages are still spoken, though in
a somewhat changed form. For those languages with a [[p.9]]

great many speakers, there is regional variation; that is,
people in different areas speaking the same language in
somewhat different ways, following patterns dating back
to the time before the unification. In short, within the
Empire there are several languages, and the major lan-
guages (that is, those with the most speakers) are spoken
in a number of versions or dialects.
     The official language of the Klingon Empire, the lan-
guage used for all official purposes, descended from that
spoken by Kahless (and, for that matter, also by Molor).
It is called {tlhIngan Hol}, literally "Klingon language,"
though this term rather effectively obscures the complex-
ity of the situation. Before restricting this discussion to
modern {tlhIngan Hol} (which is referred to as simply
"Klingon" henceforth), it is important to survey, at least
briefly, the role of other languages in the Empire, as well
as the role of ancient forms of Klingon.
     Most of the languages that are either unrelated to or
distantly related to Klingon were originally spoken on
planets other than Kronos and nearly all of these lan-
guages continue to live on their respective homeworlds.
Few of these people are monolingual, however, since
Klingon is required for commerce, interactions with
the government, and so on. In some of the larger cities
on Kronos, particularly the capital First City ({veng
wa'DIch}), there are pockets of immigrants from these
other planets who maintain their languages and customs
but do so pretty much out of the hearing of the majority
population. Speaking a language other than Klingon, un-
less everybody present understands it, is considered in-
appropriate because the speakers may be implying that
they do not trust the nonspeakers.
     Few native speakers of Klingon bother to learn these
other languages (except for the names of some foods),
but an occasional word or phrase does sometimes work
its way into Klingon proper. For example, {qajunpaQ}
("courage, audacity") comes from <kajunpakt,> a word used [[p.11]]
in this sense but literally meaning something like "glow-
ing lava" or "fiery lava" in a language originally spoken
on Krios. In Klingon, it implies courage of a rather sur-
prising or unexpected kind, perhaps even recklessness,
as opposed to {toDuj} ("courage, bravery"), which is more
neutral. Some Klingon speakers preserve the original
pronunciation, though most fall into the more usual
Klingon phonetic pattern. Probably very few Klingons
are even vaguely aware of the original connection of <ka-
junpakt> with lava, glowing or otherwise. The Klingon
word for lava, {vaHbo'}, has nothing to do with <kajunpakt>.
     Heard far more frequently than non-Klingon lan-
guages are various archaic forms of Klingon, dating from
different time periods and originating in different re-
gions, collectively known as {no' Hol} ("ancestors' lan-
guage"). The ancient forms are heard primarily, though
not exclusively, in ceremonies, songs, and classical sto-
ries.
     While the conventional phrases used in some rituals
are uttered in modern Klingon (such as those used in the
Rite of Ascension, a ceremony symbolizing a young Klin-
gon's attainment of a certain spiritual level), those used
in a great many others are in a form of {no' Hol} (such as
those associated with the {bIreqtal} [<brek'tal>], the cere-
mony in which the killer of the leader of a Klingon house
marries the widow and thereby becomes the head of the
house himself). In these cases, the phrases must be stud-
ied and memorized by the participants, then repeated
back accurately. Improvising or paraphrasing is entirely
inappropriate. Depending on when the phrases for the
ritual originated, the words and grammatical construc-
tions may be somewhat like or very different from those
of modern Klingon. If the words have survived into mod-
ern Klingon but some of the grammatical features have
not, it may sound as if the celebrant is speaking im-
proper, ungrammatical Klingon. This is not the case, [[p.12]]

though the same phrase uttered away from the ritualistic
context would be taken as such.
     Older language forms are also often found in the lyr-
ics of Klingon songs, particularly songs associated with
rituals. Among other activities at the annual <Kot'baval>
Festival, for example, the battle between Kahless and
Molor is reenacted. While dueling with their <bat'leths,> the
performers portraying Kahless, Molor, and other war-
riors sing traditional songs with words and grammatical
forms that are archaic indeed, some not in everyday use
for well over 1,000 years. In addition, virtually all of Klin-
gon opera is written in {no' Hol}. In order to follow an
opera even superficially, one should prepare before at-
tending a performance by studying the story. For a
deeper appreciation, however, it is essential to study also
the linguistic structures used in the opera's libretto. As a [[p.13]]
result, aficionados of this musical form tend to be from
the upper levels of society and rather well educated,
though this is not invariably the case. Finally, there are
some old but still popular songs that retain old words
and old grammatical forms that are not interpretable in
modern Klingon. In fact, it is not uncommon for Klingon
children to think some of these songs are nonsense
songs, filled with silly words, and then be surprised to
find out that they are ancient hunting songs or battle
songs.
     Finally, Klingon myths were originally told and re-
told, then later written down, in {no' Hol.} In modern
times, some are read or told in the original form, though
most are familiar only in their modern translations. Even
in the most up-to-date versions, however, certain lines
are so famous in their original form that they are seldom
altered. An example of this is found in the story of Kah-
less and Lukara. Following the successful defense of the
Great Hall at Qam-Chee, Kahless and Lukara engage in a
brief conversation that marks the start of their epic ro-
mance. Students have been memorizing these lines and
repeating them for so long, they have become part of the
knowledge shared by all Klingons. One need only say the
first line---"{mova' 'aqI' ruStaq}," a {no' Hol} way to say
"today was a good day to die"---and everyone will know
what is to follow. Interestingly, in the case of this particu-
lar conversation, the lines have been incorporated into a
mating ritual that persists to this day, with the man and
the woman taking the roles and repeating the {no' Hol}
lines of Kahless and Lukara, respectively, as the prelude
to a romantic encounter.
     The use of older language forms is not restricted to
rituals, myths, and songs. There are occasions when ei-
ther as a sign of erudition or just to taunt a friend one
may speak a line or two in {no' Hol}. Among some admir-
ers of Klingon history, conversations may take place en-
tirely in older language forms. Such conversations are [[p.14]]
usually of very brief duration, however, and restricted to
a few topics for which vocabulary is known.


KLINGON DIALECTS

     Even modern Klingon is characterized by variation.
There is a "standard" Klingon, used in public ceremonies
and official documents, taught in schools and studied by
foreigners, but it changes from time to time and it is not
the only way to speak. It gains its status for political, not
linguistic, reasons. With a couple of exceptions, the dif-
ferent ways of speaking---that is, the different dialects---
are not so different that speakers cannot comprehend
one another. On the other hand, each has a set of peculi-
arities that any Klingon can easily recognize, point out,
and usually mimic. For a Klingon, it is easy to tell
whether someone is speaking the standard way.
     Throughout Klingon history, and still today, if the
leader of the Empire carries the title {ta'} ("Emperor"), the
way he speaks Klingon---that is, the dialect used by his
family and people from his region---is always considered
the best way. The vocabulary and grammatical details
typical of the leader's area become the current model for
the Empire. The way other people speak, if different, is
considered somehow inferior, and the more any given di-
alect differs from that of the Emperor, the more inferior
it is considered. Not only is the way of speaking consid-
ered inferior, anyone speaking only a nonstandard dia-
lect is considered to be inferior as well, motivating
everyone to learn to speak the way the Emperor does. On
the other hand, since a change in leadership tends to
bring in an Emperor from a different lineage and differ-
ent region, the relative status of the different varieties
can easily change, with a dialect formerly associated with
a certain region becoming the standard dialect spoken
by all. As a result, the various dialects of Klingon have
persisted, with most Klingons becoming adept at several [[p.15]]
of them. The system by which the Emperor's dialect is
considered the standard dialect stayed in place even dur-
ing those times when there was no official Emperor, as
has been the case, until recently, for the last 300 years.
Regardless of the leader's title, the leader's way of speak-
ing is still considered the best. The term used for the
standard dialect, however, harks back to the Emperors:
{ta' tlhIngan Hol} (literally, "the Emperor's Klingon"),
often shortened to {ta' Hol} ("Emperor's language"). It is
appropriate to use these terms regardless of the official
title of the leader of the Empire.


REGIONAL VARIATION

     The current standard way of speaking, the {ta' Hol},
is the variety of Klingon associated with the First City
on Kronos, and this is the form of the language taught
to most non-Klingons, as if there were no other way to
speak. This is not at all surprising, since most visitors
to the Empire restrict their stay to this one city and
have very little knowledge of other parts of the Empire.
In the past, this was due to travel restrictions imposed
by the Klingon government, though now, perhaps be-
cause residents of the First City have become accus-
tomed to dealing with tourists and their habits, visitors
simply tend to feel somewhat more comfortable there
than they do elsewhere and they avoid wandering too
far away.
     Those unfamiliar with other parts of the Empire are
likewise unfamiliar with the different dialects found in
the various regions and are therefore unprepared when
they hear unfamiliar speech patterns. For the most part,
dialects in the various regions differ owing to specifics of
pronunciation, but there are grammatical and vocabu-
lary distinctions as well. The differences range from
being rather subtle to being quite noticeable. Indeed,
there are a few dialects that are so different from one [[p.16]]
another that speakers of one can barely communicate
with speakers of the other. In those cases, if it were not
for the fact that the Empire is a political whole, and, ever
since the days of Kahless, has taken great pride in being
so, the so-called dialects might be considered separate
languages.
     It is not possible to survey all of the regional dialects
here, particularly the most divergent ones, but some of
the kinds of differences that exist and that are likely to
be encountered are illustrated. Before we focus on the
linguistic peculiarities of some of the different areas,
however, a very brief discussion of Klingon geography
would seem to be in order. The Klingon Homeworld
{Qo'noS}, usually rendered Kronos in Federation Stan- [[Kronos:="Kronos"]]
dard, is a planet with basically one very large mass of
land surrounded by ocean; perhaps continent is a compa-
rable concept. Within the land mass are distinct areas,
some of which are demarcated geographically (divided
by a mountain range, for example), while the boundaries
of others seem rather arbitrary, the result, no doubt, of
ancient power struggles. A specific area whose borders
are definable, by whatever means, is normally called a
{Sep}, commonly translated as "region," though, since the
regions were politically distinct in the past, "country"
might have at one time been just as appropriate a transla-
tion. An identifiable area within a {Sep} is a {yoS} ("area,
district"), and a {yoS} usually contains at least one impor-
tant {veng} ("city"); though sometimes, especially in the
more rugged parts of a planet, there may be only a small
settlement or {vengHom} ["village"]). This terminology is [[["village"]):=("village")]]
also used when describing other planets within the Em-
pire.
     Regions are sometimes identified by the name of the
most prominent city within the region. Thus, the region
containing the First City is simply called {veng wa'DIch
Sep} ("First City region") and {voSpegh Sep} ("Vospeg re-
gion," southwest of the First City---to use directional [[p.17]]
terms familiar to speakers of Federation Standard) is
named after the city of Vospeg. Other regions have names
that are distinct from the names of any districts or cities
within them, such as the large {Sa'Qej Sep} ("Sakrej re-
gion"), several thousand kilometers east of the First City.
The origins of most Klingon place names are not known,
having been lost to history. Sometimes, however, the
meaning of a place name is clear, such as the Sakrej re-
gion's {HuD beQ yoS} ("Flat Mountain district") and, of
course, {veng wa'DIch} ("First City"). On rare occasion, a
place's name can be traced to an individual or family,
such as {Qotmagh Sep} ("Krotmag region"), derived from
{Qotmagh}, the leader of a powerful house who, centuries
ago, conquered neighboring areas, or {ruq'e'vet} ("Ruk'-
evet"), a city in the {ghevchoq Sep} ("Gevchok region"),
named for a warrior (whether actual or mythological is a
matter of dispute) who singlehandedly defeated an in-
vading force.
     Before the time of the unification of the Empire by
Kahless, the amount of interaction between inhabitants
of different regions varied. When regions formed coali-
tions in a campaign against a common enemy, interac-
tion was great; when they were in a period of mutual
antagonism, interaction was limited. Since interaction
involves people communicating with one another, this
varying amount of contact is reflected in the linguistic
situation. Dialects spoken in any given pair of regions
have some common features (vocabulary or pronuncia-
tions, for example), developed during the periods when
the people had a great deal of interaction with one an-
other; and these same dialects have some clear differ-
ences, developed during times of discord when contact
was minimal.
     In addition to the regions on Kronos (and there are
more than those mentioned above), of course, are the
various planets that have become part of the Empire. On
some, such as Morska, a dialect of Klingon has all but [[p.18]]
replaced any languages originally spoken; on others,
such as Vaq'aj II, native languages survive alongside {ta'
Hol}. Interestingly, the dialects of Klingon spoken on con-
quered planets are not as different from {ta' Hol} as are
some of the dialects on Kronos itself. That is because the
Klingon language came to the conquered planets rela-
tively recently and therefore remains somewhat similar
to that spoken by the conquerors, while the dialects on
Kronos have been spoken for a much longer period and
have had time to develop differently.
     Because the dialect of the First City is the standard
dialect, the {ta' Hol}, it is both customary and convenient
to compare other dialects to it rather than to each other.
This practice is retained in the discussions below.


Pronunciation

     Residents of various regions and territories of the
Klingon Empire may be identified by the way they pro-
nounce words---that is, by their accents. Those in the
Krotmag ({Qotmagh}) region, for example, have charac-
teristic ways of pronouncing the sounds {b} and {D}, as well
as the vowels. In {ta' Hol}, {b} is pronounced the same as <b>
in Federation Standard <bribe>. In the Krotmag dialect of
Klingon, however, {b} and {m} are pronounced identically,
both of them sounding like Federation Standard <m> as in
<mime>. Thus, for example, the members of the following
pairs of words sound exactly alike in the Krotmag dialect;
however, they sound different in Standard Klingon:

     {bup} ("quit")/{mup} ("strike")
     {boH} ("be impatient")/{moH} ("be ugly")
     {buS} ("concentrate on")/{muS} ("hate")
     {ghob} ("wage war")/{ghom} ("meet, encounter")
     {qab} ("face")/{qam} ("foot")
     {Qub} ("think")/{Qum} ("communicate")
     {teb} ("fill")/{tem} ("deny") [[p.19]]

     For the most part, this causes no problems for Krot-
mag dialect speakers. There are more homonyms (words
that sound alike) in their dialect than in other dialects,
but, as is the case with homonyms in general, context
usually serves to clarify which word is meant. Occasion-
ally, however, two identically pronounced words can be
used in such similar contexts, raising the possibilities of
at least ambiguity if not catastrophic misunderstanding,
that some interesting speech patterns have developed.
When there are nouns that sound alike, speakers are
likely to use compound nouns (that is, use two nouns
where otherwise one would do). This is probably most
clearly seen with the pair of words meaning "face" and
"foot," both pronounced {qam} (though "face" is {qab} in
Standard Klingon). Does {qamlIj vIghov} mean "I recog-
nize your foot" or "I recognize your face"? Unless the
course of the discussion clearly dictates which is meant
(as it might, for example, in a conversation when buying
shoes, though even here the possibility for ambiguity ex-
ists), there is no way to tell. In such a situation, "foot"
would probably be rendered {'uS qam} (literally, "leg
foot"); "face" would be {nach qam} (or, in the standard
dialect, {nach qab}---literally, "head face"). Interestingly,
though originally used only to avoid ambiguity with
words containing {m} and {b}, these speech patterns have
become quite common in the Krotmag region and are
used even when {m} and {b} are not involved in the words at
all. Thus, it would not be unusual to hear such utterances
as {DeS ghop} (actually, {NeS} ghop---the meaning of {N} is [[{NeS} ghop:={NeS ghop}]]
explained below) meaning "arm hand" or {nach ghIch}
("head nose"), even though the single words {ghop}
("hand") and {ghIch} ("nose") need no disambiguation.
Similarly, a house (lineage) is frequently called {qorDu'
tuq} (actually, {qorNu' tuq})---literally, "family house"---
rather than {tuq} ("house") alone, and a sword is often
termed {yan 'etlh} (or even {'etlh yan})---literally, "sword [[p.20]]
sword." This manner of speaking is quite characteristic
of this region.
     For verbs, a somewhat different tactic is employed.
In {ta' Hol}, there is no problem distinguishing {bIboH}
("You are impatient") from {bImoH} ("You are ugly"). In
the Krotmag region, however, both are pronounced
{mImoH}. To make the speaker's intent clear, it is not un-
common to add a short sentence immediately after the
potentially ambiguous one:

     {mImoH. yIjotchoH.}
     [Standard: {bIboH. yIjotchoH.}]
     ("You're impatient. Calm down!")

     {mImoH. 'oy' mInNu'wIj.}
     [Standard: {bImoH. 'oy' mInDu'wIj.}]
     ("You're ugly. My eyes ache.")
     (See below regarding Krotmag {N}.)

     Krotmag dialect speakers have a distinctive pronun-
ciation of {D} as well: it sounds like {n}, except the tip of
the tongue touches a point in the middle of the roof of
the mouth rather than one behind the top teeth as it
does for {n}. (For the sake of clarity in this discussion,
the way Krotmag dialect speakers pronounce {D} will be
written {N}, to distinguish it from {n}.) The {D} sound in {ta'
Hol} is also produced with the tongue pointing upward
and not near the teeth (just like {N}), but otherwise the
{D} sound is similar to that of Federation Standard <d> as
in <did>. For speakers in the Krotmag region, the sounds
{n} and {N} are distinct; the following pairs of words do
not sound the same (the standard form of the second
member of each pair follows in brackets):

     {naH} ("fruit, vegetable")/{NaH} ("now") [{DaH}]
     {nuj} ("mouth")/{Nuj} ("vessel") [{Duj}]
     {mIn} ("eye")/{mIN} ("colony") [{mID}]
     {nulegh} ("He/she sees us.")/{Nulegh} ("He/she sees
          you.") [{Dulegh}] [[p.21]]

     Though under most circumstances, speakers of the
Krotmag dialect can easily distinguish between the two
sounds, it is not unusual to hear a speaker add extra
elements, as if to ensure clarity: {maH nulegh}---literally,
"us, he/she sees us"; {SoH Nulegh}---literally, "you, he/
she sees you." This does not happen anywhere nearly as
frequently as it does with words with {b} or {m}, however.
Speakers of other forms of Klingon, on the other hand,
find the Krotmag pronunciations of {N} and {n} to be so
similar as to be indistinguishable. When trying to speak
in the Krotmag manner, they tend to pronounce all
words with {D} as if they used {n} instead, rather than
{N}, making it possible for a true Krotmag speaker to
differentiate a fellow resident from an outsider, but
also making communication difficult. Misunderstand-
ings, sometimes with unfortunate consequences, are
not all that uncommon.
     A third characteristic of the Krotmag accent is the
nasal quality of the vowels, caused by the air being ex-
pelled through the mouth and nose at the same time
while speaking. This in no way impedes communication
with speakers of other dialects, but it does give the dia-
lect a distinct tone.
     Although the number of speakers of the dialect of the
Krotmag region is relatively small, their speech patterns
are well known and easily recognized and have actually
had an effect on other dialects. It is not uncommon for
speakers of one dialect to imitate the speech of another,
whether as a way to mock the speakers of a nonstandard
dialect or as a way to learn about that dialect to be pre-
pared for a change in leadership. A bit of dialect mixture
results, with words or pronunciations of one dialect
being added to another. The distinctive pronunciations
of the Krotmag dialect are surely responsible for some
slang and idiomatic usages in Klingon in general. For ex-
ample, {chab chu'} (literally, "new pie") is another way to
say "new invention" or "latest innovation." This is no [[p.22]]
doubt because the Krotmag pronunciation of {chab}
("pie") is {cham}, the same as the word for "technology."
Similarly, a slang word for "sword" is {yaD} (literally,
"toe"), based on the Krotmag pronunciation of {yaD} as
{yaN}, which to most Klingons will sound like {yan}
("sword"). (Other examples of slang originating from
Krotmag regional pronunciations are found in the chap-
ter on Language Change and Staying Current, under "Vo-
cabulary: Slang," pages 142--167.) [[>>link]]
     Speaking in a manner that is sort of between that
of the Krotmag region and {ta' Hol} are the peoples of
Tak'ev ({taq'ev}), who, though still a minority population,
greatly outnumber the residents of Krotmag. These
people maintain the distinction between {b} and {m} but
pronounce the {b} as if it were {mb}; that is, starting off
as the {m} sound but ending up at a {b}. Similarly, {D} is
pronounced more like {nD} (or, more accurately, {ND}).
Thus {ba'} ("sit") would be pronounced more like {mba'};
{Hub} ("defend") would sound like {Humb}; {Du'} ("farm")
would be {NDu'}; {HoD} ("captain") would be {HoND}; and
{Dub} ("improve") would be {NDumb}. The nasal vowel
quality found in the Krotmag region is characteristic of
Tak'ev speech as well.
     The speech of residents of the planet Morska has
some identifiable phonological characteristics also. Most
striking is the absence of the sound {tlh.} Syllables ending
with {tlh} in most dialects end with {ts} (pronounced the
same as <ts> in Federation Standard <cats>) in the Morskan
dialect; at the beginning of syllables, instead of saying
{tlh,} Morskans say something that sounds very much like
a combination of standard Klingon {gh} and {l}---that is, {ghl}.
Compare, for example (Morskan/{ta' Hol}):

     {ghIts}/{ghItlh} ("write")
     {mats}/{matlh} ("be loyal")
     {ghlIngan}/{tlhIngan} ("Klingon")
     {ghlo'}/{tlho'} ("thank")
     {ghluts}/{tlhutlh} ("drink") [[p.23]]

     The Morskan dialect also pronounces {H} differently
from the standard way. At the beginning of syllables, {H}
sounds like Federation Standard <h> as in <hat>; at the ends
of syllables, {H} is not pronounced at all:

     {hIv}/{HIv} ("attack")
     {ba}/{baH} ("fire [a torpedo]")
     {hu}/{HuH} ("bile")

     Finally, {Q} at the beginning of syllables is pronounced
the same as standard Klingon {H}:

     {Hapla'}/{Qapla'} ("success")
     {Hoy}/{Qoy} ("hear")

Because of this pronunciation difference, sometimes
speakers of the Morskan dialect and those of {ta' Hol} mis-
understand one another. Words such as the following
have been responsible for the loss of more than one life:

     {Hagh}: Morskan, "make a mistake"/Standard,
          "laugh"
     {Hoj}: Morskan, "make war"/Standard, "be
          cautious"
     {HoS}: Morskan, "be sorry"/Standard, "be strong"


Grammar

     Although the basic grammar of all dialects of Klin-
gon is the same, there is some variation. The Morskan
dialect, for example, does not put the suffix {-'e'} on the
subject noun in a sentence translated with "to be" in Fed-
eration Standard (though the suffix is not missing in
other contexts where it is used to focus attention on one
noun rather than another within the sentence). Compare:

     Morskan: {tera'ngan gha qama'.} ("The prisoner
          is a Terran.")
     Standard: {tera'ngan ghaH qama''e'} ({tera'ngan,}
          "Terran"; {ghaH,} "he, she"; {qama',} "prisoner") [[p.24]]
     Morskan: {bIghha'Daq ghata qama'.} ("The
          prisoner is in the prison.")
     Standard: {bIghHa'Daq ghaHtaH qama''e'.}
          ({bIghHa'Daq,} "in the prison"; {-taH,}
          "continuous")

Sometimes the {-'e'} is heard at the end of the subject noun
in Morskan sentences of this type ({qama'} ["prisoner"] in
the examples above), leading some speakers of {ta' Hol} to
criticize speakers of the Morskan dialect for sloppiness,
claiming that sometimes the {-'e'} is heard and other times
not, with no apparent pattern. The critics are wrong: {-'e'}
added to {qama'} in the Morskan sentences would have
its usual focusing function (the sentences would mean
something like "It's the prisoner who's a Terran" and "It's
the prisoner who's in the prison," respectively), the same
as it would have in sentences of other types. This gram-
matical device is not available to speakers of {ta' Hol} who,
to speak grammatically, must use {-'e'} in sentences of this
type whether wishing to call extra attention to the subject
noun or not.
     Another interesting grammatical difference is found
in the way prepositional concepts ("above," "below," and
so on) are expressed in the speech typical of the Sakrej
({Sa'Qej}) region. In Klingon in general, such ideas are
conveyed by using a special set of nouns ({'em} ["area be-
hind"], {bIng} ["area below"], and others) that follow the
nouns whose position they are indicating. Thus, "behind
the door" is {lojmIt 'em} (literally, "door area behind") and
"below the table" is {raS bIng} (literally, "table area
below"). A pronoun may be used instead of a noun: {jIH
'em} ("behind me"---literally, "I area behind"), {chaH bIng}
("below them"---literally, "they area below"). In the Sak-
rej region, however, possessive suffixes are used in place
of the independent pronouns: {'emwIj} ("behind me"---
literally, "my area behind"), {bIngchaj} ("below them"---
literally, "their area below"). Using the possessive suffix [[p.25]]
construction when speaking {ta' Hol} will not lead to mis-
understandings, but it will associate the speaker with the
residents of Sakrej, which, depending on the political sit-
uation, may or may not be beneficial.
     A third type of grammatical difference is seen in the
grammar of toasting, an extremely common activity ac-
companying even the most casual of drinking affairs. In
{ta' Hol} and most other dialects of Klingon, when a toast
is made, certain grammatical rules apply that do not
apply elsewhere, setting toasts off from other kinds of
utterances. For example, in everyday speech, the verb
suffix {-jaj} ("may") is used to express the speaker's desire
or wish that something happen in the future, as in
{chotwI' DaSamjaj} ("May you find the murderer";
{chotwI'} "murderer"; {DaSamjaj,} "May you locate him/
her") or {jejjaj tajlIj} ("May your knife be sharp"; {jejjaj,}
"May it be sharp"; {tajlIj,} "your knife"). In both cases, the
normal rules of Klingon syntax are followed: the object,
if mentioned, precedes the verb (as in the first sentence)
and the subject, if mentioned, follows it (as in the
second).
     If either of these sentiments is given as a toast,
however, a special rule---applicable to toasts only, and
therefore better described as socially motivated than as
grammatically motivated---must be followed. In a toast,
the last word is always the verb (ending in {-jaj} ["may"]),
even if that means the subject precedes the verb. Thus,
as a toast, the first sentence, {chotwI' DaSamjaj} ("May
you find the murderer") is already well formed; the last
word is the verb phrase "may you find him/her." The
second sentence, however, must be recast if it is to be
used as a toast so that the verb comes last: {tajlIj jejjaj}
("May your knife be sharp"). If this were not a toast,
this would be grammatically unacceptable. In toasts
with both subject and object nouns, the order is object- [[object-:=object--]]
subject-verb, as in the toast {wo' ghawran DevtaHjaj} [[subject-verb:=subject--verb]]
("May Gowron continue to lead the Empire"; {wo',} "em- [[p.26]]
pire"; {ghawran,} "Gowron"; {DevtaHjaj,} "May he con-
tinue to lead it"). If uttered as a wish, hope, or
aspiration---but not as a toast---the normal word order
applies: {wo' DevtaHjaj ghawran} ("May Gowron con-
tinue to lead the empire").
     In a divergence from the majority of Klingon dia-
lects, the speakers of Sakrej and No'hvadut ({noHva'Dut})
do not follow this pattern. In these dialects, there is no
reforming of the sentences for toasts; the subject always
follows the verb. Thus, as toasts, {jejjaj tajlIj} ("May your
knife be sharp") and {wo' DevtaHjaj ghawran} ("May
Gowron continue to lead the empire") are perfectly ac-
ceptable, even though the verb ending with {-jaj} is not the
last thing in the sentence. Though always done in high
spirits, toasting is taken very seriously. It is important,
therefore, to phrase toasts correctly in order to avoid un-
wanted consequences, and this is done slightly differ-
ently depending upon where one is. A visitor from
outside the Klingon world should be aware of the speech
patterns of others present (and, to play it very safe,
should avoid making toasts with overt subjects).


Vocabulary

     Though most vocabulary is shared throughout the
Empire, there are certain regionalisms---that is, certain
words that are used fairly frequently by the speakers of
some areas but only rarely, if at all, by those of others.
(In the discussion that follows, all spellings are consis-
tent with {ta' Hol}, even in exemplifying words that are
from dialects with distinct pronunciation patterns.)
     A good deal of variation is found among the words
relating to food and food preparation. For example, in
the First City and elsewhere, there is a special word, {qet-
tlhup}, for the sauce prepared by thickening {chanDoq}
("marinade"). In some regions, the word {qettlhup} is sel-
dom used; {chanDoq jeD} (literally, "thick marinade") is [[p.27]]
used instead. Similarly, in all regions, the word {vIy-
chorgh} means "juice" or "sap"---that is, the liquid from a
plant. In some regions, however, its meaning has been
extended to also include any liquid that accompanies
food, as if a general term for "sauce." Thus, instead of
saying {ghevI'} for the sauce that normally accompanies
{qagh} ("serpent worms"), the common expression is {qagh
vIychorgh} (literally, "{qagh} juice" or the like). Likewise,
instead of using the term {'uSu'} for the sauce traditionally
offered with <gladst,> {tlhatlh vIychorgh} (literally, "<gladst>
juice") is used.
     Being hunters by nature and primarily carnivorous,
Klingons have an extensive vocabulary for different parts
of an animal, and the terminology is widespread. The
word {ghab}, however, which refers to any chunk of the
midsection of an animal, has slightly varying meanings
depending on region. In most of the empire, including
the First City, {ghab} is rather inclusive: basically, what-
ever was chopped off the animal as a single piece, with
or without bones or internal organs. In some areas, {ghab}
is never applied to a cut of meat lacking bones. Instead,
the phrase {ghab tun} (perhaps translatable as "fillet,"
though literally, "soft {ghab"}) is sometimes heard. The [[{ghab"}:={ghab}"]]
same concept would be expressed in most of the Empire,
including by speakers of {ta' Hol}, by a longer phrase:
{Hom Hutlhbogh ghab} ("{ghab} that lacks bone"). The ex-
pression {ghab tun} would probably not be used by most.
     The most common utensil used in preparing Klingon
food is the {'un} ("pot"), a word found with the same mean-
ing throughout the Empire. The names for specific types
of pots, however, exhibit some regional variation. For ex-
ample, while a large, flat-bottomed pot is usually called a
{bargh}, in some regions it is a {vutmeH 'un} ("pot for pre-
paring [food]"), sometimes shortened to simply {vut'un.}
In some regions, a {bargh} made of metal is a {mIv} (which
also means "helmet," even though, historically speaking,
helmets are not necessarily made of metal) or a {mIv [[p.28]]
{{

house. (LeVar Burton, Marina Sirtis, Jonathan Frakes, Michael
Dorn.) <Robbie Robinson>

}}
bargh} ("helmet pot"), while a ceramic {bargh} is called a
{chor} (literally, "belly") or {chor bargh} ("belly pot").
     A small amount of regional variation is also found
among words referring to body parts, though almost al-
ways, words for the different body parts are the same in
all dialects. One exception is the word for "nose," which
is {ghIch} everywhere but in some regions may alterna-
tively be called {ley'.} Another is the word for "liver," which
is generally {chej} but in some regions also {mavje'.} The
fact that Klingons have two livers does not seem to be
relevant here, since both {chej} and, for those who use the
word, {mavje'} apply to either liver.
     It is a different story with the word for "forehead."
The standard word for this prominent part of Klingon
anatomy is {Quch}, and this word is found with this mean-
ing throughout the Empire. In addition, however, practi- [[p.29]]
cally every dialect has its own alternate word for
"forehead." Indeed, {Quch} is simply the word for "fore-
head" in the First City. Among these other forms are:
{boD, jargh, mIQ, 'aQlo', Huy'Dung, tuqvol, no''och}.
While the first four of these words are simply regional-
isms for "forehead," the last three can be analyzed, at
least partially. {Huy'Dung} is probably from {Huy' Dung}
("above the eyebrow[s]"). The word {tuqvol} may contain
the word {tuq} ("house [lineage]") because family resem-
blances can be seen in forehead ridges. The second ele-
ment, {vol}, however, is otherwise unknown. Similarly, the
first syllable of {no''och} may derive from {no'} ("ances-
tors"), again suggesting something about genealogy. The
second syllable, {'och}, probably resembles {'och} ("tunnel")
only accidentally; there is no reason to think that "ances-
tors' tunnel" is a way to say "forehead."
     For the most part, regional vocabulary is indeed re-
stricted to a single region or set of regions. That is, a par-
ticular word is heard in, and associated with, one place
but not another. There are some words, however, that are
heard pretty much everywhere but have different mean-
ings in different areas. As might be expected, this could
lead to confusion and misunderstanding, so it is impor-
tant to use the right words in the right places. For exam-
ple, the word for "stairs" or "stairway" in most of the
Empire is {letlh}. One type of {letlh} is a {choghvat}, the stair-
way leading to and from the doorway of a ship. In a cou-
ple of dialects in the Mekro'vak ({meqro'vaq}) region,
however, {letlh} refers only to the stairway connected to a
ship, while {ngep'oS} is any other kind of stairway but not
one used to enter or exit a ship.
     Similarly, one needs to be careful in talking about
certain articles of clothing. In the First City, and in most
places in the Empire, {wep} means "jacket, coat" and {yIv-
beH} means "tunic"---that is, a shirt or shirtlike garment
with or without sleeves. In the Vospeg ({voSpegh}) region,
on the other hand, {yIvbeH} refers only to a sleeveless shirt [[p.30]]
(thus retaining much of the word's original meaning, a
sleeveless protective garment worn by warriors), {wep}
means a shirt with sleeves, and any jacket or coat is a
{cheSvel}, a word that elsewhere refers to a specific style
of coat associated with, not surprisingly, the Vospeg re-
gion.
     Confusion can be caused by verbs as well as nouns.
For example, while the verb {ghIH} means "be messy,
sloppy" in {ta' Hol} and in most dialects, in the towns near
Ruk'evet ({ruq'e'vet}), {ghIH} means "be careless." The
more widespread word for "be careless" is {yepHa'}, and
this word is used in addition to {ghIH} in the Ruk'evet
area. To say "be messy, sloppy," the Ruk'evet inhabitants
say {Soy',} a verb meaning "be clumsy" elsewhere. The
Ruk'evet word for "be clumsy" is {jat}, which is phoneti-
cally identical to the noun meaning "tongue." Even
though this is probably just a coincidence, there is a
slang term {jat}, used throughout the Empire but some-
what more frequently in the areas near Ruk'evet, which
means "speak incoherently, mumble," a notion with neg-
ative connotations for Klingons. Enunciating Klingon
clearly is always important, but one should take extra
care to not accidentally say {jat} ("mumble") when intend-
ing the similar-sounding {ja'} ("say"), {jatlh} ("speak"), or
{jach} ("yell").
     Finally, there are some instances of a word existing
in two regions with two utterly unrelated meanings, one
of them quite derogatory. For example, throughout the
Empire, a soup whose main component is <igvah> liver has
a special name, {ghaw'}. This word is avoided in the Vos-
peg region, however, because there, the word {ghaw'} is a
slang term meaning something like "one who is full of
self-doubt or who is insecure" and is a word used only as
an insult. To refer to the soup, one simply says {'IghvaH
chej chatlh} (literally, "<igvah> liver soup"). In most of the
Empire, to say to someone {ghaw' SoH} means only "You
are <igvah> liver soup," an odd thing to say, but more incon- [[p.31]]
gruous than anything else. In the Vospeg region, on the
other hand, to call someone a {ghaw'} is often the prelude
to a fight to the death.
     Though in nearly all cases using the standard {ta' Hol}
will serve the visitor well, it is definitely worth putting
forth whatever effort may be required to become familiar
with regionalisms if one expects to travel around the Em-
pire, especially to places distant from the First City or to
regions in which there may be some dissatisfaction with
the current leadership of the High Council. Not only will
this make communication in these places easier, it will
also facilitate building a special connection between the
visitor and the Klingons with whom he or she is interact-
ing. This is always a good idea.


Generational Variation

     It should be no surprise to find that Klingon children
speak differently from Klingon adults. The phenomenon
is found in most societies throughout the galaxy. As chil-
dren learn their language, they give distinct pronuncia-
tions to certain sounds, lack a full grasp of the grammar,
and use some words in ways adults find inappropriate.
Because the same patterns are followed by a great many
Klingon children, however, it is possible to describe cer-
tain characteristics of children's speech.
     By the time Klingon children are old enough to know
many words and speak in short but well-formed sen-
tences, most of the sounds associated with "baby talk"
are gone. Nevertheless, it takes several more years for all
of the sounds to disappear from their verbalizations, giv-
ing the speech of young children a distinctive sound. As
a rule, before a child's First Rite of Ascension, all remain-
ing traces of childhood speech have disappeared.
     Among the most noticeable features setting chil-
dren's speech apart from that of adults are the sounds of
three consonants. First, the sound {j} is often pronounced [[p.32]]
not as <j> in Federation Standard <jar,> but instead more like
the <s> in Federation Standard <pleasure> or <si> in <vision>. If
this sound is transcribed as {zh}, the verb {naj} ("dream")
would be {nazh}; {jav} ("six") sounds more like {zhav}. Sec-
ond, the sound {ng}, which, for adults, is like the last sound
in Federation Standard <sing,> is pronounced as {n} at the
ends of syllables, and more like the <ni> in Federation Stan-
dard <onion> (as if <ny>) at the beginning. Thus, the chil- [[<ny>:={ny}]]
dren's pronunciation of {mang} ("soldier") would be {man};
the pronunciation of {ngeD} ("be easy") would be {nyeD}.
Finally, the consonant {q}, in the speech of children,
sounds much more like Federation Standard <k> than an
adult {q} does. For example, {quS} ("chair") is more like
{kuS}, and {tuq} ("house [lineage]") is more like {tuk}.
     Curiously, a fourth consonantal alteration, though
relatively uncommon, is the one most associated with
children's speech. A minority of children pronounce {tlh}
as {ch}, particularly at the end of syllables. For example,
{qatlh} ("why") is pronounced {qach}, and {botlh} ("middle")
is {boch}. Though the resulting forms may be real, though
different, words ({qach}, for example, is "structure, build-
ing," and {boch} means "be shiny"), there is seldom any
confusion because the identically pronounced words are
used in such different contexts. If a child were to say
{qach jej taj,} that could mean only "Why is the knife
sharp?" ({qach}, mispronunciation of {qatlh,} "why"; {jej,}
"be sharp"; {taj,} "knife"). If {qach} were "structure," the
Klingon sentence would be as ungrammatical and non-
sensical as "The knife sharps the structure." On the other
hand, children occasionally do make unintentionally am-
biguous statements. If a child who pronounces {tlh} as {ch}
were to say, for instance, {mach SuvwI'pu'}, it is not clear
whether he or she means "Warriors are loyal" ({mach},
mispronunciation of {matlh,} "be loyal"; {SuvwI'pu',} "war-
riors") or "Warriors are small" ({mach} "be small").
     There are differences in the grammar children use,
too. Children employ the noun suffix {-oy} ("endearment") [[p.33]]
with some regularity, while it is used quite infrequently
in the speech of adults or even older children. It is usually
used with the terms for parents and other relatives
({vavoy,} "Daddy"; {SoSoy,} "Mommy"; {vavnI'oy,} "Grand-
pa," etc.) but also for other people or animals for which
a child feels some fondness ({targhoy,} "targy," perhaps,
for a pet <targ>). Some children use it with other nouns
(such as {qamoy}, perhaps "footsie," based on {qam,}
"foot"), but such usage is strongly discouraged and usu-
ally falls out of a child's repertoire before too long.
     Another grammatical feature of Klingon about which
children frequently become confused involves nouns that
are inherently plural, such as {cha} ("torpedoes") and
{ngop} ("plates [for eating]"), as opposed to their singular
counterparts {peng} ("torpedo") and {jengva'} ("plate"). In-
stead of using the special plural forms, children tend
forms plurals of these words by simply adding the plural [[forms:=to form]]
suffix {-mey} to the singular forms ({pengmey}, {jengva'-
mey}), as would be done with most other nouns (except
for those referring to body parts or to beings capable of
language, for which {-Du'} and {-pu',} respectively, would be
used), such as {yuQmey} ("planets"). Adults also add {-mey}
to these nouns, but they do so to indicate that the items
are scattered about ({jengva'mey,} "plates scattered all
over the place"). For children who say {jengva'mey}, it ap-
parently means simply "plates"; that is, it is nothing more
than the plural form of {jengva'}. Children seem to be
aware of the existence of the inherently plural forms,
however, for they use them as well, though usually with
the suffix {-mey} superfluously appended: {chamey} ("torpe-
doeses"), {ngopmey} ("plateses"). Inherently plural nouns
are considered singular as far as how they fit into the
overall grammatical structure. Thus, the singular pro-
noun {'oH} ("it") is used for both {jengva'} ("plate") and
{ngop} ("plates") in sentences such as {nuqDaq 'oH jeng-
va''e'?} ("Where is the plate?") and {nuqDaq 'oH ngop'e'?}
("Where are the plates?"; {nuqDaq,} "where?"). Children, [[p.34]]
however, tend to use the plural pronoun {bIH} ("they")
with {ngop} (as well as with {jengva'mey} and the redun-
dantly suffixed {ngopmey}): {nuqDaq bIH ngop'e'?}
("Where are the plates?").
     When speaking to small children, particularly babies
who have not yet started speaking, Klingon adults often
incorporate some or all of these aspects of children's
speech---particularly the distinctive pronunciations. This
form of speech is called {puq Hol} (literally, "child's lan-
guage"), though a better Federation Standard translation
might be "baby talk." It is entirely inappropriate for an
adult or even an older child to use {puq Hol} except when
speaking to a baby, though it is occasionally used when
speaking to pets. Using {puq Hol} to an adult is highly in-
sulting and degrading. Visitors from other cultures
should be aware that this proscription applies to the in-
teraction between mates or potential mates. Unlike in
some other places in the galaxy, use of {puq Hol} is not a
part of any Klingon courting ritual, nor is it a sign of
affection between two adults.
     As children grow older, their speech changes to re-
semble that of adults. Nevertheless, there are still some
observable differences between the speech of younger
and older Klingons, though mostly involving usage or vo-
cabulary choice rather than pronunciation or grammar.
One good illustration of this involves the tag question---
that is, the construction in which a statement is followed
by a question such as "right?" In Klingon, a tag question
is formed by adding {qar'a'} (literally, "Is it accurate?";
{qar,} "be accurate"; {-'a',} the interrogative suffix) either
after the verb or at the end of the sentence: {qarDaS-
nganpu' HIvpu' tlhInganpu' qar'a'?} or {qarDaS-
nganpu' HIvpu' qar'a' tlhInganpu'?} ("The Klingons
have attacked the Cardassians, right?"; {qarDaSnganpu',}
"Cardassians"; {HIvpu',} "have attacked"; {tlhInganpu',}
"Klingons"). The tag question is found in the speech of all
Klingons to one degree or another, but it is found quite a [[p.35]]
bit more frequently in the speech of younger Klingons.
Indeed, some members of the older generation have ac-
cused teenage Klingons of adding {qar'a'} to the end of
virtually every sentence they utter. This is an inaccurate
characterization to be sure, but it does point out an
awareness of the difference between the speech patterns
of the older and younger generations.
     The primary difference between the speech of older
and younger Klingons, however, lies in the choice of vo-
cabulary. Younger Klingons describe some of the vocabu-
lary used by their elders as {mu'mey Doy'} ("tired words"),
preferring to use what they call {mu'mey ghoQ} ("fresh
words") or even {Hol ghoQ} ("fresh language"). (The word
{ghoQ} ["fresh"], in its most narrow usage, applies to just- [[keep hyphen]]
killed meat). Perhaps "slang" is a good translation of
{mu'mey ghoQ}. Some older Klingons incorporate some
of the {mu'mey ghoQ} into their own speech, though some
claim to not understand the {mu'mey ghoQ} at all (nor are
they quite sure what the term itself means).
     Any visitor to a Klingon planet will undoubtedly en-
counter {mu'mey ghoQ} and should learn as many slang
words as possible ahead of time in order to fit in easily
and to avoid having to ask for explanations. New words
are constantly coming into use, however, so some asking
is inescapable. On the other hand, a visitor should be
keenly aware that some Klingons use more slang than
others, and some try to ignore the phenomenon entirely.
To avert potential unpleasantness, the best tactic is to
avoid using slang in conversation until someone else has
first. Examples of {mu'mey ghoQ} are given in the chapter
on Language Change and Staying Current, under "Vocab-
ulary: Slang," pages 142--167. [[>>link]]
     It should be pointed out that the vocabulary associ-
ated with rituals, martial arts, literature, opera, and the
like, though some of it may be genuinely archaic, is not
considered {mu'mey Doy'} ("tired words"). Traditions are
extremely important in Klingon culture, and the younger [[p.36]]
generation honors them fully. The term {mu'mey Doy'} is
used only in reference to everyday speech.

Societal Variation

     Klingon society is a stratified one. That is, there are
clear distinctions between those with great wealth and
influence and those with little or none. This sort of status
is a matter of inheritance. Among the higher classes, one
is born into an ancestral unit known as a {tuq}, normally
translated "house." Some houses are particularly
wealthy, controlling vast lands by means of armed forces
loyal to the particular house. Other houses have far less
influence and, for survival, often form alliances with the
larger houses. Each house is led by the eldest male direct
descendent of the previous leader (there are complex tra-
ditions dealing with what happens if there is no male
heir), and the heads of the larger houses---that is, those
with the greatest holdings and strongest forces---have
seats on the Klingon High Council ({tlhIngan yejquv}),
the body that rules the Empire. Since the number of seats
on the Council is limited, many houses are not directly
represented, are not as influential in Klingon society, and
therefore occupy a slightly lower social position. In addi-
tion to wielding great political influence, members of the
higher classes are also better educated than are others,
particularly in the area of the arts.
     Houses routinely contribute troops, ships, and weap-
onry and go into battle to help advance the Empire's ob-
jectives. On the other hand, it is not unusual for the
interests of the various houses and their leaders to be
at odds with one another, leading to hostilities between
houses, sometimes lasting generations. Depending on a
house's successes in any of these battles, its holdings---
and therefore its overall influence in the society---may in-
crease or decrease. A house's place in society may also be
adversely affected by the behavior of its leadership. If the [[p.37]]
{{

Emperor. <Robbie Robinson> [[x!]]

}} [[p.38]]
High Council determines an action to be dishonorable,
not only may it remove the leader of a house from the
Council itself, it may also seize the house's lands, forces,
and other holdings.
     Though members of the lower levels of society may
not identify themselves as members of a house, they usu-
ally have pledged loyalty to one. Typically, members of
this class work as servants or perform duties necessary
for the daily functioning of the Empire's undertakings.
Many serve as members of a house's military forces.
     The Klingon military, of course, has a hierarchical
structure of its own, with ranks and areas of authority
spelled out explicitly. Various fleets and squadrons are
loyal to various houses, though, as might be expected,
the details of these alliances are subject to change.
Within the Klingon Defense Force ({tlhIngan hubbeq}), [[hubbeq:=Hubbeq]]
which includes the entire Klingon military apparatus, the
highest officers tend to be members of influential houses,
particularly the members of the ultimate military author-
ity, the High Command ({ra'ghomquv}). It is possible,
however, for anyone to rise to higher ranks in the mili-
tary and, thereby, higher levels in society in general,
through particularly heroic actions in combat.
     Some of this social structure influences the way Klin-
gons speak. While social standing has no connection with
pronunciation (except for the lower status associated
with speakers of regional dialects differing from that of
the current leadership), there are a few grammatical dif-
ferences and some vocabulary differences that clearly re-
flect a stratified society.
     The most obvious grammatical feature associated
with social status is the verb suffix {-neS} (an honorific)
used to express a high degree of respect or honor. For
example, one might say {choQaHpu'neS}, which might be
rather awkwardly translated as "You, honored one, have
helped me." (Compare this to {choQaHpu'} ["You have
helped me."]) Though there is no situation in which the [[p.39]]
use of {-neS} is required and its use is rather infrequent,
when it is used, it is used only when addressing someone
of higher rank, such as a higher officer in the military or
a high political leader. It would not be used by a higher- [[keep hyphen]]
ranking officer, for example, when speaking to a lower- [[keep hyphen]]
ranking officer, nor would it be used when talking about
a higher-ranking person. Thus, one would not describe
being aided by a superior by saying {muQaHpu'neS} ("He/
she, whom I honor, has helped me": {muQaHpu',} "He/she
has helped me"). Of course, one does not need the suffix
{-neS} in order to speak of honor. The adverbial {batlh} ("in
an honored fashion") may be used for exactly this func-
tion, as in {batlh muQaHpu'} ("He/she has helped me in
an honored way" or "He/she has helped me with honor").
While it would be entirely inappropriate for a superior to
say to an inferior {choQaHpu'neS} ("You, honored one,
have helped me"), the superior may say {batlh cho-
QaHpu'} ("You have helped me in an honored way" or
"You have helped me with honor"). The relative ranking
of individuals may be ascertained by noting who says
{-neS} to whom.
     Ironically, members of the higher social classes are
more likely than their lower-class counterparts to violate
the normal rule involving possessives ("my," "your," "his/
her," etc.). These special constructions are formed inten-
tionally, however, so calling them "errors" would not be
accurate. As with {-neS}, this grammatical twist is not en-
countered very frequently, so when it is used, it carries a
certain amount of force.
     Normally, a possessive is formed by adding the ap-
propriate suffix to a noun, as in {vavwI'} ("my father"),
{vavlI'} ("your father"), and {vavDaj} ("his/her father") (all
based on {vav,} "father"). In the case of "my" and "your," a
slightly different suffix is used if the noun refers to some-
thing that is not capable of using language, typically an
animal or an object, as in {tajwIj} ("my knife") and {tajlIj}
("your knife") ({taj,} "knife"). When the possessor is an- [[p.40]]
other noun, as opposed to a pronoun, a "noun-noun"
construction is employed, the two nouns being juxta-
posed in the order possessor-possessed, as in {yaS vav}
("officer's father") or {yaS taj} ("officer's knife") ({yaS,} "of-
ficer"). The grammatical diversion in which members of
the higher classes occasionally indulge is to put the suffix
before the noun, as if forming a noun-noun construction.
Furthermore, only the suffixes not referring to beings ca-
pable of language are used. Thus, {wIj vav} would be used
for "my father," though perhaps the archaic-sounding
"father mine" is closer to the feel of the utterance; {lIj vav,}
perhaps "father yours." Use of these otherwise bizarre
constructions indicates an unusual closeness between
the possessor and what is possessed, comparable to the
Federation Standard practice of using a derogatory epi-
thet to show affection (as in "John, you [epithet], it's good
to see you"). Indeed, this is the best interpretation of a
phrase heard among Klingons who are particularly good
friends: {wIj jup} ("friend mine"). A translation such as
"my very good friend" or "my dear old friend" may come
closer to what is intended. It is not known with certainty
why this construction is found predominantly among the
higher classes, though it is probably because, among the
educated elite, an intentional misuse of the language
would be interpreted as a rhetorical device---even as a bit
of poetry---rather than as simply careless speech. Since a
visitor's place in the social scheme of things is not clear,
it would be best to not use the construction at all but at
the same time to refrain from expressing disapproval if
someone else uses it.
     Vocabulary associated with class distinctions falls
into two types: words used to refer to the upper classes
and words used predominantly by one class or the other.
The leader of a house is afforded the title {joH}, usually
translated as "Lord." This title is also used to refer to his
wife, translated as "Lady." If the title is used along with
the name, one puts the name first, as is the case with all [[p.41]]
titles: {Qugh joH} ("Lord Kruge"), {ghIrIlqa' joH} ("Lady
Grilka"). When addressing the head of a house, a mem-
ber of a lower class may use either the name plus {joH} or
else {joH} plus {-wI'}, the first-person possessive suffix for
beings capable of language: {joHwI'} ("my Lord, my
Lady"). This title also has an alternate form, {jaw}, which
is used from time to time with no known difference in
meaning or connotation, though {joH} is heard far more
frequently. A person of equal or close standing in the so-
cial hierarchy, perhaps the leader of another house, has
two additional options: using the name alone, or using
the father's name (thus Lieutenant Commander Worf
may be called {mogh puqloD} ["Son of Mogh"]). If the
head of a house is also a military officer, which is quite
likely, it is entirely proper to use either the title {joH} or
the rank itself. Both {Qugh joH} ("Lord Kruge") and {Qugh
la'} ("Commander Kruge") are appropriate ways to ad-
dress or refer to Kruge. Other than titles associated
with military ranks, members of the lower classes are
called only by their given names or by their fathers'
names ({mogh puqloD} ["Son of Mogh"]; {qo'leq puqbe'}
["Daughter of Ko'lek"]).
     The vocabulary used by the higher and lower classes,
though for the most part the same, shows a certain
amount of social variation. The lower classes are more
likely to incorporate slang into their speech, though this
is difficult to ascribe exclusively or even primarily to a
class difference because it is true of the younger genera-
tion of upper-class Klingons as well. (For some examples
of slang, see the chapter on Language Change and Stay-
ing Current, under "Vocabulary: Slang," pages 142--167.) [[>>link]]
The upper classes, for their part, incorporate a few ar-
chaic words into their speech. This is true among all age
groups in the upper classes. It may be considered a sign
of erudition and respect for tradition; it does not repre-
sent an aversion to change.
     The archaic words tend to come up in conversations [[p.42]]
about food. For example, the usual word for the leg of an
animal, when prepared as food, is {gham} ("limb"), the
same word used for the leg of the living animal. A leg
served as food at a banquet in an upper-class household,
however, is likely to be called a {HajDob}, an old word for
"limb." In another context, such as a meal with warriors
in a ship's {SopwI'pa'} ("mess hall"), only the term {gham}
will be heard. Similarly, the common word for "teacup"
is {Dargh HIvje'} (literally, "tea drinking vessel"). Among
the upper classes, the word {tu'lum} is used with some fre-
quency, though, strictly speaking, this archaic word used
to mean only a cup made of metal.
     Sometimes, a modern Klingon word is used but with
an archaic meaning. Thus, the normal way to describe
bland food is to call it {tlhorghHa'} ("not pungent"). In the
past, the word {jot} was used in this sense, though now its
meaning has changed to "be calm." An upper-class diner
will, from time to time, still describe food as {jot}. Along
the same lines, in an archaic form of Klingon, {ru'} meant
something like "ready to collapse or die." It was used to
describe weakened prey or a weakened enemy, but it was
also applied to food (particularly fresh organs) meant to
be eaten while still alive or just recently so, the implica-
tion being that if it were not eaten quickly, it would soon
be no good. Upper-class Klingons still use the word in
this latter sense, referring, for example to {qagh ru'} ("ser-
pent worms about to die"). The modern meaning of {ru'},
derived from the earlier senses, is "be temporary." Except
in upper-class settings, {qagh ru'} would be interpreted as
"temporary serpent worms," which would not make
much sense at all.
     Among the lower classes---except for those working
as servants for the higher classes---words like {HajDob}
and {tu'lum} are known but seldom used, and words like
{jot} and {ru'} are used only in their modern senses. Some-
times, however, a lower-class person will use an archaic [[p.43]]
word or use a word with its archaic meaning as a sign of
cultivation. If, however, the words are used incorrectly,
the speaker will be considered rather pretentious and re-
garded with contempt. It's safest to avoid such word
usage. [[p.44]]

ARGOT: SPECIALIZED
VOCABULARY

The actual size of the Klingon vocabulary is un-
known, even in rough numbers. Several thousand
words have been catalogued to date, most of them rea-
sonably common, frequently heard, and used throughout
the Empire by Klingons of all social strata. A visitor
could easily get by with a knowledge of this vocabulary
alone.
     Limiting oneself to everyday terminology, however,
would cut one off from an appreciation and understand-
ing of the richness and variety of Klingon society as well
as the sophistication of Klingon art, science, and technol-
ogy. Practitioners of a great many activities have devel-
oped specialized vocabulary or uses of words in order to
label the tools of their trade or to express subtle distinc-
tions. Such specialized language is known in Klingon as
{tlhach mu'mey} (literally, "faction words"). A good Feder-
ation Standard equivalent would be <argot> or <jargon>. In-
terestingly, some fairly common words in Klingon began
as {tlhach mu'mey} and then, over time, spread to general
usage, often with altered meanings.
     In some instances, the words and phrases associated
with a particular activity or group are known throughout
Klingon society. For example, knowledge of the language
of warfare is fairly widespread, as might be expected
given that the most striking characteristic of the Klingon [[p.46]]
Empire is that it is a warrior society. Similarly, terminol-
ogy associated with food is well known. On the other
hand, much specialized vocabulary pertaining to other
endeavors remains practically unused except by experts
in the particular fields (though most well-educated Klin-
gons probably are familiar with it).
     While it is not possible to go into every aspect of the
various Klingon subcultures here, some examples of the
{tlhach mu'mey} associated with certain fields are pre-
sented below. Even if a visitor never engages in any of
these activities directly, understanding these words is a
good way to gain a more complete comprehension of
Klingon culture. At the very least, these words are always
useful for showing off.


WARFARE

     As might be expected, the greatest degree of lexical
elaboration---the most words---can be found in the area
of warfare. Included here are words for weaponry,
armor, martial techniques, military ranks, forms of com-
bat, and so on. A great deal of this terminology is so wide-
spread in society that it forms a part of any basic
vocabulary and need not all be repeated here. Further-
more, much of the information about current weaponry
is classified and therefore cannot be included in this
guide. What remains, however, does indeed give a good
indication of the importance of warfare to the Klingon
way of life.


Wars, Battles, and Warriors

     There are two nouns traditionally translated as
"war": {veS} and {noH}. The first, {veS}, is "war" in the sense
of "warfare," the concept or idea of war; {noH}, on the
other hand, is used for an individual or specific war.
When Azetbur, leader of the Klingon High Council at the [[p.47]]
time of the first negotiations for peace with the Federa-
tion, expressed concern that "war is obsolete," she said,
{"notlh veS,"} not {"notlh noH"}; she felt the idea or nature [[{":="{]] [["}:=}"]]
of warfare, not a specific war, was obsolete ({notlh}). In
parallel fashion, any specific "battle" is {may'}, but the con-
cept of battle is {vIq}, often translated as "combat."
     Similarly, there are several verbs for "fight," "battle,"
and the like. Most broadly, "do battle" or "wage war"---
that is, actually engage in a conflict in which a number
of combatants are involved---is {ghob}. The notion of
"make war" in the general sense, referring to the <idea> of
war and not a <specific> war, is {Qoj}. The verb for "fight,"
whether in a war or a one-on-one confrontation, is {Suv}.
     In short, the nouns {veS} ("war, warfare") and {vIq}
("combat") and the verb {Qoj} ("wage war") all are used to
refer to the ideas of warfare, combat, and making war,
while the nouns {noH} ("war") and {may'} ("battle") and the
verbs {ghob} ("make war, do battle") and {Suv} ("fight") are
used when referring to specific, concrete instances of
war, battle, and fighting.
     Thus, it is possible to say {noH ghob} or {noH Suv},
both meaning "He/she fights a war," or {may' ghob} or
{may' Suv,} meaning "He/she fights a battle," but it is not
normally acceptable to say {veS ghob} ("He/she fights a
warfare") or {vIq Suv} ("He/she fights a combat").
     In addition to these general terms, there are a num-
ber of specific words relating to specific types of battle or
engagement. First of all, there is a set of verbs that can
each be translated "clash with," "encounter," "engage,"
and the like, but these translations do not make the dif-
ferences between the words clear. They are differentiated
by degree, ranging from something like "struggle in a
minor skirmish" to "engage in a major melee." Arranged
in ascending order of ferocity, they are: {Qor}, {tlhaS}, {vay},
{lul}, {Hargh}. If Klingons engaged in shadowboxing, {Qor}
might be appropriately applied, while {Hargh} would be
reserved only for situations approaching Armageddon. [[p.48]]

     Common militaristic acts also have associated termi-
nology, both verbs ({DoHmoH,} "drive back"; {Hub,} "de-
fend"; {yot,} "invade"; {weH,} "raid" [same as {yot}, really, but
with the added connotation of surprise or speed]; {HIv,}
"attack, assault"; {Sev,} "contain"; {HeD,} "retreat, with-
draw") and nouns ({yot,} "invasion, raid, incursion"; {Hub,}
"defense"). The noun {tuH} refers to a military maneuver
of any kind. A specific plan or stratagem usually has a
code name ({per yuD} [literally, "dishonest label"]) coined
especially for the occasion and not necessarily used
again. A {per yuD} is sometimes the name of an animal,
sometimes the name of a Klingon historical figure, and it
usually ends in {Qu'} ("mission, task"). Code names are the
equivalent of Federation locutions such as "Operation
Cougar" and are therefore often translated in that pat-
tern: {targh Qu'} ("Operation <Targ>"), {lung Qu'} ("Operation [[p.49]]
Dragon"; a {lung} is not really a dragon, but that is a close
approximation), {'aqtu' Qu'} ("Operation Aktuh").
     Since dying in battle is considered a noble aspiration,
suicide missions are a part of the Klingon military reper-
toire, and the honorable nature of such missions ac-
counts for their nomenclature. The honorific verb suffix
{-neS}, usually used when addressing a superior, is also
used when the verb refers to a suicide attack of some
kind: {HIvneS}, awkwardly translated as "honor-attack,"
implies that suicide is part of the plan of the attack. Simi-
larly, {HubneS} ("honor-defend") is used only when sui-
cide is part of the defense plan. To say "attack honorably"
but not refer to a suicide mission, the adverbial {batlh} is
employed and the suffix {-neS} is not: {batlh HIv} ("attack
honorably, attack in an honorable fashion").
     Along the same lines, the verb suffix {-chu'} ("per-
fectly"), when used with some verbs of fighting, implies
that the fight results in death. From the Klingon point of
view, {Suvchu'} ("fight perfectly") is "fight to the death." A
similar construction is used for dueling ({Hay'chu',} "duel
to the death"). On the other hand, {-chu'} does not add
this meaning to all verbs. {HeDchu'} ("retreat perfectly")
means simply that there is a full withdrawal; though
death may occur as part of the retreat, it is not necessar-
ily implied by the verb. The archaic Klingon phrase {ghIq-
tal} also means "to the death," though it is generally used
as a sentence in its own right, a type of exclamation. For
example, just before striking the first blow or firing the
first shot in a battle, warriors may shout {ghIqtal!}
     The participants in a war or battle are key. The quint-
essential Klingon person, of course, is the warrior, and
there are several words for "warrior." The most com-
monly heard term is {SuvwI'} (literally, "one who fights" or
"fighter"). This word is used in most circumstances and
is never inappropriate. Indeed, it is often preferred be-
cause it states explicitly what a warrior does: fight. Other
words for "warrior" are {mang} and {vaj}. The word {mang} [[p.50]]
is used when the warrior under discussion is described
in terms of his membership in a fighting unit (for exam-
ple, as a crew member on an attack cruiser). Perhaps for
this reason it is sometimes translated "soldier." The usual
plural form of {mang} is a different word altogether: {negh}
("warriors, soldiers"). The word {mangpu'} ({mang} plus the
plural suffix {-pu'}) is seldom used, but it is not ungram-
matical. It carries with it the notion that there are indi-
viduals (more than one {mang}) making up the group;
{negh} focuses on the group as a unit. A similar word,
{QaS}, normally translated "troops," is used in almost the
same way as {negh}, but it excludes officers. All of the
{negh} together make up something called a {mangghom}.
Literally, this is "warrior group" or "soldier group," but it
is usually translated as "army."
     The third word for "warrior," {vaj,} refers more to the
notion of warriorhood or the idea of being a warrior than
it does to an individual warrior. In this way, it resembles
{veS} ("warfare") and {vIq} ("combat") (see above). Thus,
Captain Klaa, who took it upon himself to take revenge
against the Federation's Captain James T. Kirk, remarked
that he needed a real challenge to test "a warrior's met-
tle," or {vaj toDuj} (literally, "warrior courage"). He was
not referring to his own courage or that of any specific
warrior (which would have been, in all likelihood,
{SuvwI' toDuj}), but rather to the kind of courage embod-
ied in being a warrior.
     Warriors are grouped according to the ships upon
which they serve. A ship's full complement of personnel,
crew plus officers, is called a {wey}, perhaps best trans-
lated as "company." The general word for "officer" (in ad-
dition to the specific terms for various ranks) is {yaS}. An
individual crew member is a {beq}. ({QaS} ["troops"] applies
to nonofficers whether or not assigned to a ship.)
     There is a second term for "officer," but it is not fre-
quently used. As is well known, it is considered the duty
of officers on Klingon ships to assassinate their immedi- [[p.51]]
ate superior if the higher-ranking officer has been judged
unfit to serve, perhaps as a consequence of neglecting his
or her duty, demonstrating cowardice, or behaving dis-
honorably. This practice extends even to the captain of
the ship. As a result, there are not many officers who end
their service to the Empire by simply stepping down or
retiring. There are some, however, and the word {'utlh} is
used to refer to an officer of this type. Perhaps "officer
emeritus" is an appropriate translation.
     The entirety of a government's military apparatus is
its {QI'}, usually translated simply as "military." The word
is rather general in that it may apply to a nongovernmen-
tal military organization as well, such as that of a group
of rebels. Though many Klingons themselves are apt to
describe the Federation's Starfleet as a type of {QI'}, this is
not really an appropriate use of the term, since {QI'} refers
to the military only, while the functions of Starfleet are
scientific and diplomatic as well. This misapplication of
the term may, in part, be responsible for the frequent
misunderstandings between the Federation and the Em-
pire.
     The official Klingon {QI'} is the Klingon Defense
Force, or {tlhIngan Hubbeq}, which is run by the Klingon
High Command, or {tlhIngan ra'ghomquv}. The Defense
Force is subdivided into units known as {yo'} and {naw-
logh}, traditionally translated as "fleet" and "squadron,"
respectively, but the relationship between the two is not
straightforward in terms of chain of command. While a
{yo'} always consists of more than one {nawlogh}, there are
a number of {nawloghmey} (the plural form of {nawlogh})
that are independent of any association with a {yo'}. There-
fore, while a specific {nawlogh} may be under the com-
mand of a {yo'}, another {nawlogh} may have the same
status as a {yo'} within the overall forces. Accordingly,
when dealing with a troop member ({QaS}) or officer ({yaS})
of a ship, to avoid giving offense, one should either find
out ahead of time how that ship fits into the hierarchical [[p.52]]
structure or else carefully avoid making references to
other units as superior or inferior.
     The words used as titles to denote the rank ({patlh})
within the Klingon Defense Force have caused a certain
amount of confusion, largely because the system does
not neatly map onto that used by Starfleet. The highest
military officer, the head of the Klingon High Command,
is the {la'quv}, usually translated "Supreme Commander."
There are nine ranks of officers ({yaSpu'}, the plural form
of {yaS} ["officer"]) serving under the {la'quv}, and below
them are the troops ({QaS}), including some with titles.
The officers ({yaSpu'}) are ranked as follows (from highest
to lowest, each given with its usual Federation Standard
translation):

     {'aj} ("admiral")
     {Sa'} ("general")
     {totlh} ("commodore")
     {'ech} ("brigadier")
     {HoD} ("captain")
     {la'} ("commander")
     {Sogh} ("lieutenant")
     {lagh} ("ensign")
     {ne'} ("yeoman")

     When used with an individual's name, a title follows
the name: {tlha'a HoD} ("Captain Klaa"), {cheng Sa'}
("General Chang"), {qeng la'} ("Commander Kang"), and
so on.
     There is, in addition, a frequently misunderstood
word, {ra'wI'}, which is correctly, though misleadingly,
translated as "commander," as is {la'}. The confusion
comes about because {ra'wI'} literally means "one who
commands," from the verb {ra'} ("command, order") plus
the suffix {-wI'} ("one who does [something]"). Thus, a
{ra'wI'} is, literally, someone who gives an order. The word
is generally used to refer to any officer of the rank of [[p.53]]
{Sogh} or higher. It may be used as either a description
({ra'wI' ghaH qImlaq'e'} ["K'mlak is a commander"]) or a
title ({qImlaq ra'wI'} ["Commander K'mlak"]), though in
all cases it is understood as not reflecting the precise rank
of the individual. Except for formal occasions, it is safe
to use the title {ra'wI'}. In fact, if one is not sure of an
officer's rank, it is probably the safest route to take.
     Finally, the special title {la''a'} ("commandant") is used
for officers in charge of certain specialized units within
the military, such as prison camps, regardless of the offi-
cers' official ranks.
     Among the troops ({QaS}), the highest-ranking are
given the title {bu'}, traditionally translated as "sergeant,"
while the next highest have the title {Da'} ("corporal"). No
specific titles are used for anyone of lower rank.
     There are a number of words employed to describe
the specific functions performed by officers on a ship, but
none of these is used as a title. For example, the science
officer is the {QeDpIn}, the communications officer is the
{QumpIn}, the weapons officer is the {nuHpIn}, the engi-
neering officer is the {jonpIn}, the tactical officer is the
{ya}, and the helmsman is the {DeghwI'}. It is not correct,
however, to say {qImlaq ya} ("Tactical Officer K'mlak").
On the other hand, one might say, {ya ghaH qImlaq
Sogh'e'} ("Lieutenant K'mlak is the tactical officer"). Sim-
ilarly, regardless of their official ranks, those closest to
the captain of a ship are called {yaS wa'DIch} ("first offi-
cer") and {yaS cha'DIch} ("second officer"). Unlike the
terms associated with specific duties, however, these may
be used as titles as well. It is correct to say both {qImlaq
yaS wa'DIch} ("First Officer K'mlak") and {yaS wa'DIch
ghaH qImlaq la''e} ("Commander K'mlak is first offi- [[la''e:=la''e']]
cer"). Finally, a student may be described as a {mangHom}
("cadet"), but {mangHom} is not an official title. One
should not say, for example, {qImlaq mangHom} ("Cadet
K'mlak"). [[p.54]]


Weaponry: Modern

     As with other technologically advanced peoples,
Klingons have developed rather sophisticated weaponry.
Intricate details aside, much of it is similar to the weap-
onry of other societies in the galaxy, notably Federation
and Romulan, and therefore should be familiar to a ga-
lactic visitor.
     Perhaps the most characteristic of the modern Klin-
gon armaments---though, strictly speaking, not an arma-
ment at all---is the cloaking device ({So'wI'}). Most, if not
all, Klingon ships are equipped with such a device that
makes it all but impossible for them to be detected by
enemies' sensors. The workings of the {So'wI'} are appar-
ently based on the Romulan cloaking device, the Klin-
gons having learned (some would say "stolen") the
technology during their brief alliance with the Romulan
Empire in the mid-twenty-third century. The {So'wI'} is
not perfect, however. For one thing, ways have been de-
veloped to detect a cloaked ship, though these techniques
are difficult and may not work quickly enough to allow
an appropriate reaction. The device also requires so
much of the ship's energy to operate that it is not possible
to fire weapons while the ship is cloaked.
     A cloaking device that did allow weapons to be fired
while the ship was cloaked was developed by Klingon sci-
entists and actually installed on one ship, but that ship
was detected anyway and further development of the im-
proved technology seems to have been put on hold. In
this case, traditional Klingon values seem to have pre-
vailed over potential tactical advantage. From the Klin-
gon point of view, firing while cloaked, and therefore
being unseen and unknown by the enemy, would have no
honor. The {So'wI'} that must be deactivated before firing
weapons remains a standard part of a ship's equipment.
     The terminology associated with using a cloaking de-
vice is simply {chu'} ("activate") and {chu'Ha'} ("deacti- [[p.55]]
{{

known vessel that can fire its weapons with shields raised. [[?? with cloaking device engaged]]

}}
vate"). It is also appropriate to say {Duj So'} ("He/she
cloaks the ship") or {Duj So'lu'pu'} ("The ship is cloaked";
literally, "Someone or something has cloaked the ship").
     Klingon technology has produced two weapons used,
as far as is known, only by the Klingons themselves. The
{tuQDoq}, variously translated as "mind-sifter" or "mind- [[keep hyphen]]
ripper," is a device that can read the contents of a sub-
ject's brain. It is considered a weapon because, at higher
powers, it leaves the victim in a permanent vegetative
state (though it does not seem to have this effect against
those with particularly strong mental faculties, such as
Vulcans). The second distinctly Klingon weapon is the
{QIghpej}, a hand-held device that produces excruciating
pain when pressed up against an adversary.
     Scientific research has also provided the Klingons
with a range of rather advanced but more familiar arma- [[p.56]]
ments. Among these are the disruptors or, more properly,
phase disruptors, directed-energy weapons similar in
function and operation to the Federation's phasers. The
general term for disruptor is {nISwI'}. A disruptor pistol
or hand-held disruptor (and there are several models of
these) is a {nISwI' HIch}; a disruptor rifle (likewise with
several models) is a {nISwI' bej}. Larger and more power- [[bej:=beH]]
ful disruptors are mounted on the ship, laid out as
{nISwI' DaH} or "disruptor banks." These terms are used
only for these Klingon weapons. The more general term
{pu'}, "phaser," may also apply to the Klingon disruptor,
but it is used just as often to refer to the Romulan dis-
ruptor, Federation phaser, and other similar devices.
Since the word is short, {pu'} is heard frequently---even
more frequently than {nISwI'}---especially in the throes of
combat, in such formations as {pu'HIch} ("phaser pistol"),
{pu'bej} ("phaser rifle"), {pu'DaH} ("phaser banks"), and [[bej:=beH]]
even {pu'beq} ("phaser crew," the crew members responsi-
ble for the operation of the weapons). Despite the preva-
lence of the {pu'} words, in the strictest sense, the correct
names for all of these weapons are the {nISwI'} forms.
     The disruptor pistol, when not in use, may be carried
in a holster, or {vaH}, worn on the side of the body and
attached to the belt.
     The verb used for "shoot" when referring to disrupt-
ors is {bach}. Technically speaking, one shoots the energy
beam from the disruptor. The general word for any en-
ergy beam ("ray") is {tIH}, so a disruptor's beam is {nISwI'
tIH}. Thus, the correct formation is {nISwI' tIH bach}
("shoot the disruptor beam"). As a practical matter, how-
ever, the {tIH} is often left out, and {nISwI' bach} is the
common way to say "shoot a disruptor." Similarly, {pu'
bach} is "shoot a phaser."
     Ships are also equipped with an explosive weapon
called a {peng}, usually translated as "torpedo," though
"missile" might work just as well. The plural form of
{peng} is a different word, {cha}. A {peng} is launched from a [[p.57]]
tube usually called a {DuS}, but another term, {chetvI'}, is
also used, the distinction having something to do with
how the projectile is actually loaded into the tube. The
verb used for "launch" or "fire" a weapon of this type is
{baH}, and there is even a special word, {ghuS}, meaning
"prepare to launch." The warhead of the torpedo is called
its {jorneb} (which seems to contain the verb {jor} ["ex-
plode"] but is otherwise not analyzable).


Weaponry: Traditional

     The real distinction between Klingon weaponry and
that of other societies is found among the traditional
hand-held weapons used in one-on-one combat, for these
best embody the true essence of the warrior. So central
is the warrior to Klingon life, one might expect Klingons
to actually shun high-tech weaponry, arguing that bat-
tling by means of disruptors, torpedoes, and especially
cloaking devices is cowardly and contrary to the true
warrior spirit. After all, touching a colored light on a con-
trol panel is hardly the same experience as staring into
the face of one's enemy while lunging toward him with a
drawn blade. Indeed, elements of Klingon society were
highly resistant to technological innovation, but they
were ultimately convinced by others of its practical ad-
vantages. Nevertheless, the traditional forms---and
tools---of combat have endured, and not just as anachro-
nistic curiosities. Along with the ancient skills and imple-
ments, of course, is the associated terminology.
     A warrior's full set of armor, including weapons and
clothing, is his {may'luch} (literally, "battle gear"). Tradi-
tional clothing worn in battle, known as {HIp}, the word
currently used to mean "uniform," had both a protective
function and a more utilitarian one, since it was from the
clothing that weapons ({nuHmey}) or ammunition ({nIch})
could be hung. Klingons are not now and never have
been ones to shy away from injury, considering it nothing [[p.58]]
more than a natural consequence of battle. On the other
hand, lessening the severity of an injury was seen as a
means to prolong a battle. Accordingly, the traditional
warrior's tunic ({yIvbeH}) was made of a material (what it
was is now unknown) resistant to puncture, just to add a
little protection. Accompanying sleeves ({tlhaymey}), orig-
inally not parts of the tunic itself, were generally made of
animal pelts ({veDDIrmey}), skin ({DIr}) with fur ({veD}) still
attached. (In modern usage, the word {yIvbeH} in most
places means any shirt, with or without sleeves.) A war-
rior's glove ({pogh}), also made of skin, had wide band
around the wrist and sharp protrusions at the knuckles.
If there was a special name for these protrusions, it is
lost; they are now called simply {DuQwI'mey} ("spikes").
The gloves did not have fingers. They were designed to
protect the palm, back of the hand, and wrist, but to not
interfere with the mobility of a warrior's fingers. Modern
gloves ({poghmey}) generally adhere to this design. A skin
belt ({qogh}) both held pants ({yopwaH}) in place and pro-
vided a place from which to hang weapons or weapon
holders. On the toe of each high boot ({DaS}), likewise
made of animal hide ({DIr}), was a clawlike spike called a
{pu'}. The word {pu'} now means "phaser," and the newer
meaning probably developed from the older "spike" be-
cause of the lightning speed with which one delivered a
blow with the sharp {pu'}. In contemporary Klingon, the
spike on the toe of a boot is always called a {DaSpu'}
("boot spike"), never {pu'} alone. Finally, old armor in-
cluded headgear of some kind apparently called a {mIv},
which, in modern Klingon, means "helmet." The word
also survives in the word {mIv'a'} ("crown"; literally, "big
helmet" or "great helmet"), a ceremonial headpiece worn
by some Klingon emperors.
     Perhaps the single weapon most associated with
Klingons is the two-handed sword called {betleH}, or <bat'-
leth> as it has come to be known in the Federation. Ac-
cording to Klingon tradition, the first <bat'leth> was forged [[p.59]]
{{

[[image]]

The <bat'leth> of Kahless is recovered by Kor (John Colicos) and
Worf. <Robbie Robinson>

}}
by Kahless the Unforgettable, the founder of the Klingon
Empire, from a lock of his hair dipped in molten lava.
Kahless created the name {betleH}, meaning "sword of
honor." The word {betleH} is actually an archaic form. In
contemporary Klingon, "sword of honor" would be {batlh
'etlh}, though this phrase is used almost exclusively as a
translation or explanation of the older word, {betleH}.
     There is an extensive vocabulary for the moves asso-
ciated with <bat'leth> use. To thrust or lunge toward one's [[p.60]]
opponent, for example, is {jop}. To deflect a thrust---that
is, to parry---is {way'}. To thrust either end of the <bat'leth>
(as opposed to the long part of the blade) upward is
{chaQ}. To change the approximate orientation of the
weapon from horizontal to vertical is {ngol}; the reverse is
{lev}. To slide the blade of one's <bat'leth> along the blade of
the opponent's weapon is {DIj}. To twirl or rotate the <bat'-
leth> is {jIrmoH} and to toss it from one hand to the other
(the same word is used whether left to right or right to
left) is {baQ}. When teaching someone to use the <bat'leth,>
the tutor will shout out movements---for example, {yIjop!
yIway'!} ("Lunge! Defend!"). Generally in such a situa-
tion, however, the tutor will use the shortened form of
the language known as Clipped Klingon and skip the im-
perative prefix {yI-}, leaving only the bare verb: {jop! way'!}
It is important to note that the tutor is giving the student
direct commands ("Lunge! Defend!"), not shouting out
the names of movements.
     A smaller, one-handed version of the <bat'leth> is the
{meqleH}, rendered in Federation Standard as <mek'leth>.
For a minority of Klingons who pronounce both {b} and {m}
identically, as {m}, the words {betleH} and {meqleH} sound
almost the same, especially when shouted in the heat of
battle. Because of the importance of the <bat'leth> in Klin-
gon tradition, however, they have taken to calling the
<bat'leth> {betleH quv} (pronounced {metleH quv}), or "hon-
ored <bat'leth,"> while the <mek'leth> is {meqleH matlh}, or
"loyal <mek'leth."> Although {betleH quv} might be consid-
ered a bit redundant ("honored sword of honor"), it does
the job of maintaining the distinction. The longer {betleH
quv} and {meqleH matlh} are sometimes heard even
among Klingons who pronounce {b} and {m} distinctly,
though not as frequently as the one-word forms.
     The word {'etlh} is used for "sword" in general, but it
really means "blade" of any kind. The {'etlh}, then, is a
component of a knife and could be part of a spear as well.
Another word normally translated "sword," {yan}, is more [[p.61]]
specific, referring to swords (that is, weapons with long
blades) only. There is also the verb {yan}, which means
"wield or manipulate (a sword)." A "swordfighter," then,
would be a {yanwI'}, literally a "sword wielder"); the word [[, := (]]
for the specific type of sword may be, but need not be,
included. It is thus proper to say {betleH yanwI'} (<"bat'leth>
wielder") or {betleH yan} ("He/she wields a <bat'leth>").
     A {'etlh}, even if primarily a weapon, may be used in
other activities as well, such as hunting and even sculpt-
ing. Indeed, to restrict the use of a {'etlh} to combat is to
minimize the flexibility of its design. By the same token,
a blade not designed as a weapon may be used as a
weapon if need be, though to be attacked by a warrior
wielding something that is normally classified as a tool is
considered by some to be an insult to one's honor.
     In ancient times, a warrior often wore a {Ha'quj} ("bal-
dric"), a belt across his chest to support a sword when it
was not in use. The word survives today, meaning not
only "baldric" but also "sash," a common part of a war-
rior's uniform whether or not he carries a blade. Though
originally utilitarian in nature, the {Ha'quj} has taken on
symbolic functions as well, its ornamentation represent-
ing the family unit or house ({tuq}) of its wearer.
     There are a good many types of Klingon knives. The
general word for any knife is {taj}. The three-bladed war-
rior's knife (one main blade plus two smaller blades that
spring out at the base of the blade) is {Daqtagh}, some-
times rendered <d'k tahg> in the Federation. In addition to
the extra blades (frequently termed {tajHommey} ["little
knives"]), at the end of the knife's handle ({ret'aq}) there is
a spiked pommel, called simply {moQ} ("sphere"). A
"spike" is a {DuQwI'} and the small spikes on the <d'k tahg>
are usually called {DuQwI'Hommey} ("little spikes").
     The {qutluch}, or <kut'luch> in its usual Federation Stan-
dard spelling, is a knife associated with Klingon assas-
sins. It has a serrated blade ({Ho' 'etlh} [literally, "tooth
blade"]), so it is particularly lethal. It is also used in a [[p.62]]

ritual to which it gives its name, the {qutluch tay} (<"Kut'-
luch> Ceremony"), during which, as a demonstration of
courage, a young Klingon preparing to be a warrior at-
tacks someone and actually draws blood for the first
time. For Klingons, bloodletting is a usual and expected
part of a warrior's training regimen.
     Some other knives are the wavy-bladed {QIS}, the slen-
der-bladed {ghonDoq}, and the {tajtIq}, a knife with a par-
ticularly long blade that is used almost as if it were a [[p.63]]
sword. A knife that is relatively safe, both for user and
intended victim, is the smaller {naH taj} (literally, "vegeta-
ble knife" or "fruit knife," a kind of knife used for training
but also for cutting parts off of growing plants).
     A knife is more than utilitarian. The knifesmith takes
pride in designing a weapon that not only performs well
and perfectly fits the hand of the user but that also is
considered a work of art. The aesthetic value of the blade
is directly related to its effectiveness, but the handle is
adorned with ornamentation ranging from traditional
designs to symbols that actually indicate ownership, usu-
ally by means of a family crest ({tuq Degh}).
     In addition, there are also a number of knives de-
signed not as weapons but rather as tools, used only for
cutting. These are not as sharp as the weapon knives, nor
as artfully decorated. While it is not uncommon to praise
the workmanship or design of a warrior's knives, it is im-
portant to focus only on the weapons. To praise the tools
is an insult. The general term for a knife used as a tool is
the same term used for a knife as a weapon, namely {taj}.
If context is unclear, this could lead to some confusion.
When clarity is required, the tool knife may be called a
{pe'meH taj}, a "knife for cutting."
     When not in use, knives are carried in sheathes worn
on the side of the body, connected to the belt. The word
for this sheath is {vaH}, the same as the word for "holster"
but surely representing an older meaning of the term.
     The traditional Klingon arsenal also includes the ax,
an implement with a heavy, flattened blade mounted
crosswise at the end of a handle. The general term for ax
is {'obmaQ}. Its handle is its {DeS} and its blade is its {ghIt}.
These words, {DeS} and {ghIt}, when referring to humanoid
anatomy, mean "arm" and "open, flat hand" (as opposed
to a fist), respectively, suggesting that at one time the ax
was considered an extension of the warrior himself. A
double-headed ax is a {jey'naS}, while an ax with an added [[p.64]]
spike at the end is a {'alngegh}. To wield or swing an ax is
{Qach}.
     There exists a weapon that might be described as a
cross between an ax and a <bat'leth>. The {'aqleH} has what
looks like half a <bat'leth> at the end of a handle. To manip-
ulate the {'aqleH} is {Qach}.
     A general term for "spear" is {naQjej}, but, of course,
there are specific types of spears. The {ghIntaq}, for exam-
ple, is a battle spear, though it is also used ceremonially.
The shaft of a spear is the {tIH}; the sharp tip or spearhead
is the {QIn}. As might be expected, there are a great many
different types of {QInmey} (the plural form of {QIn}). A
plain spearhead, one that is simply a sharp point, is a
{QIn pup} ("perfect spearhead"). A tip with multiple points
is a {QIn vagh} ("spearhead number five"), though this is a
bit odd because there may be any number of points and
no other spearheads are named with numbers. A spear-
head that is barbed is a {SeDveq}, a word with unknown
etymological origins and otherwise unused.
     Some spears are simply thrust into an oncoming
enemy. Others are generally thrown. The thrower first
lowers the spear to a horizontal position (the verb de-
scribing this action is {ghuS}), then hurls it with great
force ("throw" or "hurl" in this manner is {chuH}). The
verb {chuH}, which is more accurately translated as
"spear"---that is, "hurl a spear at," can be used only if the
projectile being thrown is a spear or somehow resembles
a spear. The object of the verb is the intended target: {jagh
chuH SuvwI'} ("The warrior spears the enemy," or "The
warrior throws [a spear] at the enemy"; {jagh,} "enemy";
{SuvwI',} "warrior"). One way to indicate that the target is
actually hit is to add the suffix {-chu'} ("perfectly") to the
verb: {jagh chuHchu' SuvwI'} ("The warrior spears the
enemy perfectly, the warrior hits the enemy [with a
thrown spear]").
     There is, in addition, at least one type of spear, the
{tlhevjaQ}, which employs a {chetvI'}, a stick with a hook [[p.65]]
at the end, as an aid for throwing. There is a single verb,
{wob}, that is used to describe the full range of activities
involved in putting the spear properly into the spear- [[keep hyphen]]
throwing aid and using the air to hurl the spear: {tlhevjaQ [[air:=aid]]
wob} ("He/she puts the {tlhevjaQ} into the {chetvI'} and
hurls the spear"). In speaking of this type of spear and
spear-throwing technique, it is still proper to use the verb
{chuH} when talking about throwing the spear at a target.
     It may have been noticed that some of the terminol-
ogy associated with spears is identical to that associated
with modern weaponry, and certainly the vocabulary of
spear-throwing was adapted for the newer technology.
The meaning of {tIH}, originally "shaft" of a spear, was
extended to include shaftlike energy---that is, "beam" or
"ray." The verb {ghuS} means both "lower (a spear) to a
horizontal position in preparation for throwing" and
"prepare to launch (a torpedo)." The word {chetvI'} refers
to both the tool used to help throw the {tlhevjaQ} spear
and also a torpedo tube of a particular kind. Finally,
though not connected to weaponry, the word {QIn} means
not only "spearhead" but also "message." In this case, it
is not clear which came first. Perhaps the spearhead was
always thought of as the message being delivered by the
spear or spear wielder.
     Of similar shape to a spear, but utterly distinct, is the
painstik, {'oy'naQ}, a long staff that emits a powerful (and
painful) jolt of electricity ({'ul}). Though not an implement
of ancient origins (its use of electricity attests to that),
it is nonetheless usually used ceremonially, playing an
important role in the {nentay cha'DIch}, or Second Rite of
Ascension, as well as the {SonchIy}, a ceremony associated
with a leader's death. Its use is not restricted to ritual,
however; it is also used to help keep large animals under
control. Though never part of the traditional Klingon ar-
senal, its potential effectiveness justifies classifying it as
a weapon.
     The most ancient and primitive of the Klingon weap- [[p.66]]
{{

takes its form from the ancient {jeqqIj}. <Bruce Birmelin> [[x!]]

}} [[p.67]]
ons is the {jeqqIj}, the club or bludgeon. This weapon is
made of wood, sometimes with inlaid rocks, and is heav-
ier at one end than the other. Included in this category is
the {ghanjaq}, often translated as "mace," a club with a
metal head, sometimes sporting spikes ({DuQwI'mey}). As
with axes, to wield or swing a club is {Qach}.
     As protection against these various weapons, a war-
rior often carried a shield, or {yoD}, basically a large plate
of metal. The verb form of "shield" is also {yoD}, and to
"shield oneself" is {yoD'egh}. (Although the Federation
Standard word "shields" refers to both the old hand-held
protective armor and the force field protecting a vessel---
the newer meaning clearly based on the older---in Klin-
gon, there is no connection between the two. The force
field on a ship is called {botjan}. To shield a ship, one must
"activate the shields," or {botjan chu'}.)
     A weapon that is particularly good, that is well de-
signed and well constructed, is normally described as
{vaQ}. Thus, a {taj vaQ} is a meticulously made knife and a
{ghanjaq vaQ} is an especially nice mace. In speaking
about a fine weapon, one could compliment it even fur-
ther by adding the emphatic {-qu'} to {vaQ}. A really spectac-
ular <bat'leth> would be a {betleH vaQqu'}. The word {vaQ} is
not often used in describing the newer weapons (disrupt-
ors and the like), though such locutions are heard from
time to time. The original meaning of {vaQ} has been ex-
tended to mean "effective, vigorous, aggressive" and is
now heard applied not only to weapons but also to peo-
ple: {SuvwI' vaQ} ("aggressive warrior").


Duels and Challenges

     Dueling---that is, challenging someone to a fight, usu-
ally to the death, over a matter of honor---is a longstand-
ing Klingon practice. The verb meaning "duel" is {Hay'},
and it may be properly used in such constructions as
{Hay' chaH} ("They duel"; {chaH,} "they"), {Hay'chuq} [[p.68]]
{{

[[image]]

Insulted by Worf's "betrayal," Chancellor Gowron (Robert
O'Reilly) challenges him. <Robbie Robinson>

}}
("They duel one another"), or even {'avwI' Hay' yaS} ("The
officer duels the guard"; {'avwI',} "guard"; {yaS,} "officer").
To "duel to the death" is {Hay'chu'} (literally, "duel per-
fectly"), and it may be used in the same contexts: {Hay'-
chu' chaH} ("They duel to the death"; {Hay'chuqchu'} [[";:=");]]
("They duel one another to the death").
     A duel is preceded by one party issuing a challenge
to the other. This is expressed by using the phrase {qab-
Daj 'ang} (literally, "He/she shows his/her face," referring
to the Klingon tenet that a warrior always shows his or
her face in battle). To challenge someone to a duel, one
will give the command {qablIj HI'ang} ("Show me your
face!"), though this is often shortened to simply {HI'ang}
("Show me!"). When one does this, he or she is said to
"demand" or "require" ({poQ}), a short way to say {qab legh
'e' poQ} ("He/she demands to see a face"). There is some [[p.69]]
nonlinguistic behavior that may occur along with or in-
stead of the traditional phrases. To challenge one to a
duel to the death, one hits one's adversary with the back
of the hand ({chap}). If one is hitting someone for some
other reason, such as simple enjoyment, one uses the fist
({ro'}).
     The challenged party may agree to the duel by an-
swering {vISo'be'} ("I don't hide it") or the lengthier {qab-
wIj vISo'be'} ("I don't hide my face"). This person is said
to {'angchu'} ("show clearly"), the usual shorthand way of
saying {qabDaj 'angchu'} ("He/she shows his/her face
clearly"). One accepts a challenge ({qab 'ang} [literally,
"shows face"]) in order to prove one's honor ({quv tob}
[literally, "test honor conclusively"]). Though any per-
ceived attack on one's honor may prompt one to issue
a challenge, in one traditional form of duel, the goal is
specifically for a man to "win the favor of a woman" ({vuv
be' 'e' baj} [literally, "earn that a woman respect him"])
by competing with another man.
     There are a number of weapons typically used for
duels, the most common being the <bat'leth>. When the
parties are ready, a third party, sort of a referee, says
{moq}, the signal to begin. The verb {moq} literally means
"beat" and it is a clipped form of, perhaps, {vImoq} ("I beat
it") or even {vImoqpu'} ("I have beaten it"). In times past,
one would hit something (such as a drum) with a stick to
indicate the start of the duel; today, one simply says the
word "beat."
     A duel ends, normally, with death. It is often the case,
however, that one of the combatants will have been out-
maneuvered and will find himself in a position from
which he clearly cannot recover. Should this occur, he
will probably shout out {baq}, a clipped form of {yIbaq}
("Terminate it!"). It is not normal in this context for him
to shout out something like {HIHoH} ("Kill me!"), even
though this is what he means. [[p.70]]

MUSIC

     Although Klingon music is performed rather infre-
quently outside of the Empire, music plays a vital role in
Klingon culture, particularly vocal music. Warriors have
long celebrated great achievements and key events in
song, reinforcing the importance of the accomplish-
ments and actually reliving them while singing. Great
deeds are "deeds worthy of song," as the Klingon leader [[p.71]]
Gowron once put it, and part of the appeal of engaging
in battle is the prospect that, if the battle is a really good
one, it will be fought over and over again in song.
     The Klingon word for music is {QoQ}. This refers to
any music, vocal or instrumental or both together. A song
is a {bom}, and to sing a song is likewise {bom}. The set of
lyrics to a song is termed {bom mu'} (literally, "song word"
or "song words"). The word for "perform music,"
whether instrumental or vocal and instrumental to-
gether, is {much}, which in other contexts means "pres-
ent," as in "present a gift" to someone. A musician is a
{muchwI'} (literally, "one who performs music"); a singer
is a {bomwI'} ("one who sings").
     The word used for "compose" is {qon}. This verb also
means "record" and is used whether the recording is by
hand (that is, written or even etched in stone), in a me-
dium suitable for a computer, or any other form. From
the Klingon point of view, a song is not the product of an
individual's mind. It has somehow always existed and is
waiting for someone (the songwriter or, more accurately,
song recorder, {qonwI'}) to transcribe it ({qon}) and then
present it ({much}) to others. There are a number of very
well known songwriters, and it is quite an honor if one of
them composes a song about one's exploits. Currently,
perhaps the most respected {qonwI'} is Keedera.
     Though one occasionally hears someone say {QoQ tIv}
("He/she enjoys [the] music") or {bom tIv} ("He/she enjoys
the song"), music is not really considered something that
causes pleasure. Among Klingons, pleasure is deemed
quite unessential for one's well-being. More frequently,
the appreciation of music is expressed in terms of some-
thing that music does to the listener rather than in terms
of the listener's reaction. Thus, music is said to embolden
({jaqmoH}), excite ({SeymoH}), encourage ({tungHa'}), or to
stimulate or inspire ({pIlmoH}). Another common way to
say that a specific piece or performance of music has a
particularly strong effect on a listener is to employ the [[p.72]]
verb {DuQ} (literally, "stab"): {muDuQ bom} ("The song
stabs me," or, in a more colloquial Federation Standard
form, "The song moves me"). If the music is judged posi-
tively---that is, if the listener likes it---the music is said to
be {'ey}, using the word normally translated as "delicious"
when talking about food. Rendering {'ey bom} as "The
song is good" is acceptable, but it fails to capture the real
feeling of the Klingon.
     Traditional Klingon music is generally performed
only by those who have had a great deal of training. The
study of this type of music, whether composition or per-
formance, is considered a discipline not unlike a martial
art. There are precise forms and complex rules, and mas-
tery of the techniques takes years of study and practice.
Traditional Klingon musical forms date back to the time
of Kahless, if not earlier, and have shown little variation
since then.
     Older Klingon music was based on a nonatonic
scale---that is, one made up of nine tones. Each tone has
a specific name, comparable to the "do, re, mi" system
used in describing music on Earth. The nine tone names
are (the first and ninth, as with Earth's "do," being the
same): {yu}, {bIm}, {'egh}, {loS}, {vagh}, {jav}, {Soch}, {chorgh}, {yu}.
While the first three (and ninth) of these words appar-
ently are used only for singing the scale, the remaining
five are also numerals: {loS,} "four"; {vagh,} "five"; {jav,} "six";
{Soch,} "seven"; {chorgh,} "eight." It is possible that, at
some time in the past, the numerals were "borrowed"
into the lexicon of music in order to sing the scale but,
for some reason, the first three (presumably {wa'}, {cha'},
{wej} ["one, two, three"]) were either changed or never [["one, two, three":="one," "two," "three"]]
used. It is far more likely, however, that the borrowing
went in the other direction. As is well documented, the
Klingon counting system was originally a ternary system
(one based on three, with numbers higher than three
formed from the words for "one," "two," and "three").
Later, owing to outside influences, it changed to a deci- [[p.73]]
mal system (based on ten). The independent words for
the numbers three through nine were not originally a
part of the Klingon counting system, but they had to
come from somewhere. The musical scale is the likely
source. The word for the fourth musical tone, {loS}, began
to be used for the number four, and so on through the
eighth tone, {chorgh}. (The origins of the words {Hut}
["nine"] and the suffix {-maH}, used in the words for "ten,"
"twenty," "thirty," and so on, are obscure.)
     Among the traditional musical forms is what has
come to be known as Klingon opera, or {ghe'naQ}. This
form of music is stylistically rigorous, following specific
patterns both in terms of composition and performance.
There are those who vary somewhat from the tight struc-
ture, but the traditional style, sometimes called {ghe'naQ
nIt} (perhaps "grand opera," though literally something
like "unsullied opera") is preferred by purists.
     The stories acted out in Klingon operas may be
adapted from a variety of sources: legends, history (par-
ticularly military history), famous works of literature.
Occasionally, an opera presents an original plot. To fol-
low the story, one has to prepare ahead of time. First of
all, the performance of Klingon opera is quite stylized---
that is, unnatural. Certain actions are exaggerated,
others are condensed (a certain arm movement, for ex-
ample, may indicate a battle has been fought and won).
Perhaps more significant, however, is that with rare ex-
ception, the libretto of a Klingon opera ({bom mu'}, the
words) is in an ancient tongue heard now only in the op-
eras and certain classic theatrical works. From time to
time, a famous opera has been translated into contempo-
rary Klingon, but this is generally considered a learning
tool, hardly {ghe'naQ nIt}. True devotees will study the
original libretto, often learning to sing the arias them-
selves.
     Klingon "popular" music, for lack of a better term
(there is no Klingon word referring exclusively to this [[p.74]]
type of music), is more free-form; indeed, it is character-
ized by its almost rebellious nature. This is not to say
that any specific song may be modified at will. Quite the
contrary---the words, melody, and rhythm of any given
song change very little over time. For new songs, how-
ever, stylistic innovation is both acceptable and com-
mendable. The words to popular songs sometimes follow
the same linguistic tradition as Klingon opera and some-
times are in the modern language.
     There are several types of Klingon musical instru-
ments. Collectively, they are known as {QoQ jan} or {QoQ
janmey} (the plural suffix {-mey} is never required). {QoQ},
as noted above, means "music"; {jan} is normally trans-
lated as "device" and is usually applied to some sort of
sophisticated apparatus, but its use in {QoQ jan} may
point to an earlier and less limited meaning, something
like "implement." There are special words used to de-
scribe the various techniques employed in playing spe-
cific instruments, but the general term for "play a
musical instrument" is {chu'}, which, when applied to
technologically advanced devices, including weapons,
means "activate." Indeed, out of context, {jan chu'} could
mean either "activate the device" or "play the instru-
ment," which may be why {QoQ jan} ("musical instru-
ment") is seldom shortened to simply {jan}. When the
context is clearly musical, a "player,"---that is, one who
plays a musical instrument---is a {chu'wI'}, though more
specific terminology may also be used, depending on the
instrument being played.
     There are a great many Klingon percussion instru-
ments---that is, instruments that make a sound as a result
of something striking something else. Klingons seem to
enjoy playing the percussion instruments more than in-
struments of other types. Among these are various drums
and bells. The general term for a percussion instrument
of any kind is {'In}. Some types of {'In} are struck with the
hand, either palm ({toch}) or fist ({ro'}), depending on the [[p.75]]
particular instrument. To hit the instrument with the
palm is {weq}; to strike it with the fist is {tlhaw'}. Other
members of this group of instruments are hit with a stick
of some kind. The stick often resembles a small hammer;
when it does, it is termed {mupwI'Hom} (literally, "small
striker"). A plain stick is a {naQHom} (literally, "small
cane" or "small staff"). To strike the instrument with a
stick is to {moq} ("beat") the instrument. The {'In} itself may
be made entirely of metal (in which case it might be de-
scribed as a bell, though in Klingon it is simply termed
{baS 'In}, or "metal {'In}") or entirely of wood ({Sor Hap 'In,}
"wood {'In}"). One kind of {Sor Hap 'In} is a tube, open on
both ends, with a longitudinal slit extending not quite to
either end. It is hit with a {mupwI'Hom}. Drums made of
animal skin stretched over a cylinder of various materials
are found but are not as common as other types of per-
cussion instruments. Such a drum is called a {DIr 'In} (lit-
erally, "skin {'In}"). A {DIr 'In} usually has the skin stretched
only over one end. A type of drum with skin stretched
over both ends is called a {'o'lav}.
     Wind instruments (there is no overall term for them)
range from the simple flute or fife ({Dov'agh}), generally
crafted from a bone, to the highly complex {meSchuS}.
This is a very large instrument, not at all easily moved
from place to place, which consists of a network of inter-
locking tubes. One tube terminates in the mouthpiece
({ngujlep}) into which the player blows ({SuS}). The instru-
ment's pitch and timbre are modified by fingering strate-
gically placed holes in the tubing and by moving the
hands in various ways (to move the fingers in this way
is to {Heng}). The sound emitted by the {meSchuS} most
resembles that of large pipe organs, but that character-
ization is not really flattering to either instrument.
     A third category of Klingon instrument is the {SuS-
Deq}, the "windbag" or "bellows" type. A {SuSDeq} has a
flexible bag, usually made of animal skin, which is alter-
nately filled with and emptied of air. This air passes over [[p.76]]
strips of various materials ({joQmey}), which vibrate as
the air goes by, producing the musical tones. For one
form of {SusDeq}, the {may'ron}, the player stretches the [[SusDeq:=SuSDeq]]
bag out to fill it with air and squeezes it together to empty
it while directing the flow of air by pressing buttons
mounted on boards on either end of the bag, much like
an accordion. To finger the {may'ron---}that is, to push the [[---}:=}---]]
buttons---is to {Heng}, the same word applied to the
{meSchuS}. To alternately squeeze and stretch out the bag
part of the {may'ron} is to {rey}. Another type of {SuSDeq},
the {DIron}, resembles and is played much like bagpipes.
The verb that means "squeeze the bag part of the {DIron},"
usually with the elbow, is {qeb}.
     Finally, a fourth type of instrument is one with
strings, a {HurDagh}. Each string is a {SIrgh}, a word also
used for any thread or filament. A {SIrgh} of the finest
quality is made from a material secreted by insects, simi-
lar to the silk produced by silkworms. To produce music,
one may either pluck ({pang}) or strum ({yach}, which also
means "stroke" or "pet") the strings. The tone produced
is varied by touching the string or strings at various
points while plucking or strumming. The verb used for
this, perhaps translatable as "to finger," is the same as
the one used for wind instruments: {Heng}. The word {Hur-
Dagh} refers to any of these stringed instruments, of
which there are several different types, the most com-
monly found being the relatively small {Supghew}. The
midsize {leSpal} is fairly widely used, while the large {tIng-
Dagh} is rarely heard except in conjunction with the per-
formance of an opera.
     Despite the variety and sophistication of Klingon
musical instruments, most Klingon music is vocal, with
or without instrumental accompaniment. When there is
an instrumental component, the players are said to {qat}
the song. The verb {qat} literally means "wrap, encase," the
imagery apparently being that the instrumentation adds
the final, though not absolutely necessary, touches. [[p.77]]

monastery on Boreth created the clone of Kahless. <Robbie Robinson>

}}
     Perhaps the most important type of song is the {may'
bom}, literally "battle song," which commemorates fa-
mous battles and heroic exploits. It is never inappropri-
ate to burst into song (there is a special verb for this:
{wup}) and sing a {may' bom}. At any social gathering, in
addition to eating and drinking, there is no question that
there will also be singing.
     A {van bom}, literally "salute song" or "tribute song,"
is something like a hymn or anthem (indeed, "hymn" and
"anthem" are common translations of {van bom}) in that
it is sung at occasions where it is appropriate to express
one's feelings of loyalty and dedication to someone or
something. Most typically, a {van bom} praises the Klin-
gon Empire itself, often invoking its founder, Kahless.
     A song sung while going to, or returning from, a hunt
is a {chon bom}, or "hunt song." Among the songs sung [[p.78]]
exclusively to or by children is the {najmoHwI'} (literally,
"one that causes one to dream"), or lullaby, and the {Dap
bom} (literally, "nonsense song"), which teaches and rein-
forces Klingon musical patterns, even though the words
themselves are, for the most part, meaningless. The {bang
bom}, or love song (though a more literal, and perhaps
telling, translation is "beloved's song") plays an impor-
tant role in Klingon courting behavior, though exactly
how it fits in depends on the particular tradition being
followed, and this depends, for the most part, on the re-
gion in which one or the other of the participants in the
courtship ritual grew up.
     Finally, despite the undisputed importance of the
battle song, the most frequently heard type of song is the
{HIvje' bom}, the drinking song. The word {HIvje'} really
refers to a drinking glass of any kind (a goblet, tumbler,
wineglass, mug), so a {HIvje' bom} is literally a "drinking
glass song," perhaps so named because the glass is alter-
nately filled and emptied (that is, the beverage is con-
sumed) as singing continues. A {may' bom} ("battle song"),
{chon bom} ("hunting song"), or just about any other kind
of song may serve as a {HIvje' bom}, but there are special
songs heard almost exclusively as accompaniments to
drinking. The drinking songs are always sung loudly (this
would probably be described by using the term {pe'vIl}
["forcefully"]), seldom with instrumental accompani-
ment, and they tend to be rather lengthy ({nI'}) and, from
a non-Klingon perspective, repetitive.


VISUAL ARTS

     Carving and, to a lesser degree, painting also play
prominent roles in Klingon society. Statues are found in
public spaces, weapons and uniforms are embellished
with distinctive decoration, ceremonial implements fea-
ture classic patterns. A visitor to the Klingon Empire [[p.79]]
should have at least passing familiarity with the funda-
mentals of Klingon art.
     There is no single Klingon word comparable to the
general Federation Standard terms "art" and "artwork."
Vocabulary associated with the Klingon arts is rather
specific. The closest to a general term in this realm may
be the verb {raQ,} which means "manipulate by hand, han-
dle." It can be applied to carving, sculpting, metalwork-
ing, and the like but is really much less specific, referring
to activities that involve having some control over some
object. For example, in addition to saying {betleH yan}
("He/she wields a <bat'leth>"), one could say {betleH raQ}
("He/she controls a <bat'leth>"). By extension, the term {raQ}
is also used when referring to controlling a space vessel
"manually" (that is, when the controls are manipulated
directly by a person rather than a computer): {Duj raQ}
("He/she controls the ship manually").
     One of the most highly developed of the Klingon arts
is sculpture. A statue of any kind, realistic or abstract, is
a {Hew}. Realistic statues are found in public spaces, most
notably the Hall of Heroes ({Subpu' vaS}), which features
likenesses of famous Klingon warriors. Some particu-
larly famous statues are reproduced in miniature and are
found in Klingons' homes. The most frequently seen of
these, commonly referred to as {ghobchuq loDnI'pu'}
("the brothers fight one another"), is a depiction of Kah-
less in hand-to-hand combat with his brother Morath. [[brother:=brother,]]
     Statues are carved of stone ({nagh,} "rock, stone") by
various techniques. Thus, among other things, the sculp-
tor ({Hew chenmoHwI'} [literally, "statue creator"]) may
{nan} ("gouge"), {tey} ("scrape"), or {ghItlh} ("engrave"). To
apply these techniques, specialized tools are employed:
the {nanwI'} ("chisel"; literally, "gouger"), {teywI'} ("file"; lit-
erally, "scraper"), and {ghItlhwI'} ("stylus"). The word
{ghItlhwI'} (literally, "engraver") is also used for any writ-
ing implement as well as for any person who writes. In-
deed, the verb {ghItlh} is most commonly translated as [[p.80]]
"write," but it always refers to the act of writing---that
is, of making marks on some surface---not to the act of
composition. Its use in the contexts of both sculpting and
writing suggests that writing began as carving. In addi-
tion to the specialized tools, any blade ({'etlh}), even if de-
signed for other purposes, may be used as a sculpting
tool. Kahless himself is said to have used his <bat'leth>, the
original "Sword of Honor," to carve a statue for the
woman he loved, presumably Lukara.
     The part of a weapon with ornamentation, such as
the handle ({ret'aq}) of a knife, is usually decorated by
means of carving. Even modern weaponry, such as a dis-
ruptor pistol ({nISwI' HIch}) or disruptor rifle ({nISwI'
bej}), is decorated. For example, typically the head of any [[bej:=beH]]
rivet ({veragh}) used has a raised image of some kind,
often that of a Klingon warrior's head. Sometimes extra
ornamentation, carved of a different material, is
attached. This would typically be the case with a family
crest ({tuq Degh}).
     Carving or incising is also done on flat surfaces, usu-
ally a stone panel or {nagh beQ} (literally, "flat rock"), a
term that has been extended to mean the resulting art-
work itself as well as similar pieces, including paintings.
Such carvings are sometimes just ornamental, some-
times informational (if the Klingon writing system,
{pIqaD}, is incorporated into the design), sometimes rep-
resentational. What the Federation would classify as a
painting---that is, a {nagh beQ} featuring an image not
carved into it but painted onto it---is made by applying
{rItlh} ("pigment, paint, dye") derived from either an ani-
mal or plant source. This may be done either by using
fingers ({nItlhDu'}) or an implement called a {rItlh naQ}
("pigment stick"), a stick with flattened ends. The ends
(sometimes referred to as the {nItlhpachDu'} [literally,
"fingernails"]) are made in assorted sizes, making it pos-
sible to produce varied patterns. No doubt because of the
phonetic similarity of the words {nItlh} ("finger") and {rItlh} [[p.81]]
{{

time, as evidenced by his traditional <bat'leth>. (Terry Farrell)

}}
("pigment"), the practice of applying pigment with fin-
gers, and the habit of referring to the ends of pigment
sticks as {nItlhpachDu'}, a pigment stick is also often
called a {nItlh naQ} (literally, "finger stick"), though this
term is used almost exclusively by the artisans them-
selves. The word {DIj} means "use a {rItlh naQ}, paint with
a {rItlh naQ}." The same word is used in the context of
battling with swords to refer to the sliding of one's blade
along that of the opponent. The verb {ngoH}, meaning
"smear" in other contexts, is used for "paint using fin-
gers."
     Compared to Federation Standard, Klingon termi-
nology associated with colors is rather limited. First of
all, there is no noun meaning "color." There is, however,
a verb, {nguv}, which means something like "be dyed,
stained, tinted," though it is seldom used except in the [[p.82]]
phrase {chay' nguv} ("How is [it] tinted?") or when suf-
fixed with {-moH} ("cause") in the form {nguvmoH} ("dye,
tint, stain"; that is, "cause to be dyed," etc.)---for example,
{ret'aq nguvmoH} ("He/she stains the knife handle").
     As for the specific colors, in addition to the verbs {qIj}
("be black") and {chIS} ("be white"), there are only two
terms used: {SuD} ("be blue, green, yellow") and {Doq} ("be
red, orange"). For everyday purposes, these four words
suffice, since there is usually not much reason to distin-
guish, on the basis of hue alone, between two items that
are both, say, {Doq} ("red, orange"). When it is necessary
to talk about colors more precisely, as it might be for the
creator of a {nagh beQ}, various devices are employed.
One option is to make use of the emphatic suffix {-qu'}.
The word {Doqqu'} (literally, "very {Doq}") refers to a color
more red than orange. Similarly, {SuDqu'} ("very {SuD}")
would probably be described as "green" in Federation
Standard. Phrases containing the words {wov} ("light,
bright") or {Hurgh} ("dark") further refine the description
of the color. Thus, {SuD 'ej wov} means "(it) is {SuD} and
light," a way to refer to a yellowish tinge; {SuD 'ach wov}
("{SuD} <but> light") is also heard. If more specificity is nec-
essary, the item in question is generally compared to
something else that typically has a particular color. For
example, {Doq 'ej beqpuj rur} means "(it) is {Doq} and re-
sembles <bekpuj,"> a common mineral that is bright or-
ange. Note that with the basic terms, the verbs, or verbs
plus the emphatic {-qu'}, may be used adjectivally and
modify preceding nouns: {bIQ SuD} ("blue/green/yellow
water"), {HIq Doqqu'} ("red liquor"---probably blood-
wine). This adjectival construction is not possible with
the lengthier formations, however. To describe yellow tea
({Dargh,} "tea"), one must say {SuD Dargh 'ej wov} ("The
tea is {SuD} and light") or {SuDbogh Dargh 'ej wovbogh}
("The tea that is {SuD} and light"). The fact that neither
{SuD} nor {Doq} includes what is called "violet" or "purple"
in Federation Standard may be related to Klingon physi- [[p.83]]
ology---that is, exactly how the Klingon eye processes dif-
ferent wavelengths of light.


FOOD

     Klingons are, arguably unjustly, infamous through-
out the galaxy for their cuisine. Though the gastronomi-
cally uneducated might consider Klingon food to be
nothing but small animals (still alive) or chunks of barely
dead animals thrown together indiscriminately with
odoriferous herbs, to make Klingon food properly actu-
ally involves a great deal of study, practice, and just the
right touch. There are, of course, practitioners of greater
and lesser skill, but one must never be careless when pre-
paring food. A well-fed warrior is prepared to battle any
enemy and claim glory for the Empire; a warrior dis-
pleased with his meal looks to the cook for retribution.
     Actually, "cook" is a convenient but misleading term.
The Klingon verb {vut}, customarily rendered as "cook" in
Federation Standard and used in reference to food only,
might better be translated simply as "prepare, make, fix,
assemble" in order to avoid association of the word with
heat. This is not to say that heat never plays a role in
Klingon food preparation, but rather that it is not a de-
fining feature of the process. There are specific words for
specific activities involved with food preparation, but {vut}
is a general term for all of them. In fact, {vut} can also be
used in reference to making a beverage, whether simply
mixing ingredients together (such as putting cream in
coffee) or starting from scratch (such as brewing ale). A
Klingon food and/or beverage preparer is a {vutwI'} (for
convenience, this will continue to be translated as
"cook"). A bartender, on the other hand, is a {chom}. The
term for food of any kind (including beverages) is {Soj}.
An individual dish or course is called a {nay'}, and a full
meal usually consists of four or five {nay'mey} ("dishes"), [[p.84]]
though a non-Klingon might prefer to start with one or
two.
     The lack of time or absence of food-preparing facili-
ties---for example, while on a lengthy hunt---is no imped-
iment to having a good meal. A larger animal may be
sliced into pieces or a section of a plant may be broken
off. This food is often described as {Soj tlhol} ("raw, un-
processed food"), as opposed to {Soj vutlu'pu'bogh}
("food that somebody has prepared"). What makes the
food {tlhol} is not that it has not been heated but rather
that no one has done anything to it; thus, "unprocessed"
might be a better translation than "raw". On the other
extreme is {Soj qub---}literally "rare food, uncommon [[---}:=}---]]
food" but used as the Klingon equivalent of haute cui-
sine, food usually served only on the most formal of occa-
sions.
     Well-prepared food is described as {'ey} ("delicious"),
the word also used to describe good music: {'ey Soj} ("The
food is delicious"); {Soj 'ey} ("delicious food"). Food also
resembles music in that if it affects one in an especially
positive way---that is, if the food particularly satisfies the
eater---one may say {DuQ Soj} ("The food stabs him/her").
All food is considered to be good in its natural state; it
takes the intervention of a "cook" to ruin it. Thus, the
word {'eyHa'}, used to describe food that is edible but is
not particularly tasty, means something like "undeli-
cious," implying that someone caused it to cease being
delicious. For food that has been prepared particularly
poorly, it is not uncommon to hear {Soj raghmoHlu'pu'}
("The food has been decayed" or "Someone has caused
the food to decay") or the more pointed {Soj Daragh-
moHpu'} ("You have caused the food to decay"), even
though the food has not literally decayed. On the other
hand, one may simply use the word {'up} ("disgusting, re-
pugnant"): {'up Soj} ("The food is disgusting").
     In terms of texture, Klingon food may be {ngal}
("chewy"), {char} ("slimy"), or {tlher} ("lumpy"), all consid- [[p.85]]
ered positive attributes (depending, of course, on the par-
ticular dish). Other than that which is served alive, the
best meat is {ghoQ} ("fresh, just killed"). A vegetable or
fruit that is {baQ} ("fresh, just picked, just fallen off the
plant"), on the other hand, is not as favored as one that
is {DeH} ("ripe," though "overripe" might be closer to the
mark) or even {QaD} ("dry, dried out").
     To the Klingon palate, the best food tastes {tlhorgh}
("pungent," though some non-Klingons may prefer to
translate the word as "rank" or "gamy"). The opposite of
{tlhorgh} is {tlhorghHa'}, conventionally translated as
"bland" but literally meaning "unpungent," the implica-
tion being that the natural punch has somehow been
taken out of the food as a result of how it was prepared.
The same ideas are often expressed idiomatically. When
talking about the quality of a dish, one may say {jej pach}
("The claw is sharp"; that is, the food is pungent) or
{jejHa' pach} ("The claw is dull"; in other words, the food
is bland, where {jejHa'} ["dull"] really means something
like "de-sharpened"). Klingon food also frequently tastes
{wIb} ("sour, bitter") or {na'} ("salty, brackish"). The closest
equivalent to "sweet" is probably {na'ran rur} ("resembles
a <naran>," a fruit whose juice is sometimes added to
sauces as a contrast to the other flavors.) Interestingly,
many human visitors seem to really enjoy the juice of the
<naran> all by itself, particularly in the morning, though
Klingons find this practice most peculiar. Despite the
general absence of sweet foods from their diet, Klingons
tend to be quite enthusiastic about {yuch} ("chocolate"), at
least in its purest forms.
     The usual Federation Standard translations of the
primary tastes ("pungent," "sour," "salty") are a little de-
ceptive. From the Klingon point of view, it is not accurate
to say that a particular food <is> sour; rather, it <tastes and
smells> sour. That is, sourness is not an intrinsic quality
of the food; it is a perception, the effect the food has upon
the senses of smell and taste, the Klingon sense of smell [[p.86]]
being particularly highly developed. Translations such as
"sour-inducing" ({Soj wIb,} "sour-inducing food"; {na' Soj,}
"The food induces saltiness") would perhaps be closer to
the feeling of the Klingon, but they are a bit clumsy.
     The verb meaning "smell"---that is, "sense odors"---is
{largh}. The word for "emit a smell" is {He'}. This does not
necessarily imply a bad smell. Odors are not considered
"good" or "bad"; they are just odors. There may be a sub-
jective evaluation of the <source> of the odor, however. It is
a compliment to suggest that someone smells like <rokeg>
blood pie not because the smell itself is good, but rather
because the food carries with it positive associations. On
the other hand, it is most insulting to say that someone
smells like rotting <forshak.>
     The verb {mum} ("taste") means "sense flavors." To say
{Soj vImum} ("I taste the food") is to say "I perceive a fla-
vor or flavors," not "I try out the food to see if it is pre-
pared properly." This latter meaning of "taste" is
expressed by the verb {waH}, which can also be used more
generally to mean "try out, test, use experimentally."
     The Klingon diet consists primarily of animal matter.
With a few notable exceptions, plants seldom form the
bases of dishes in their own right, though they are used
quite a bit in food preparation, particularly as seasoning.
Water is consumed, but never as the beverage of choice.
     It is not possible here to give detailed accounts of
how to prepare specific dishes or even to list all of the
ingredients. Nor is it possible to explain and compare the
cuisines of different regions and planets within the Em-
pire. For detailed information of that kind, the best
source is probably {jabmeH} by J'puq (the title means <In
Order to Serve>; it is a cookbook). Nevertheless, any visitor
to a Klingon restaurant (or, if one is lucky, a Klingon
home) should be familiar with some basics (and some
basic vocabulary).
     Perhaps the most representative Klingon food, cer-
tainly the one best known outside of the Empire, is <gagh> [[p.87]]
(or, in Klingon, {qagh}): serpent worms in a thick sauce
(called {ghevI'}). Prior to the preparation of this dish, the
worms are fed only {'Iw puj} ("diluted blood"; literally,
"weak blood"), which the worms find unappetizing and
therefore consume only when they are nearly starving.
(The type of animal from which the blood has been taken
has a great deal of influence on the eventual flavor of the
{qagh}, and individual cooks, as well as individual eaters,
have their own preferences.) As the final step in prepar-
ing the dish, the worms are poured into a bowl filled with
the {ghevI'} (sauce), which contains, among other ingredi-
ents, pellets of an extremely flavorful herb that the hun-
gry worms quickly ingest, even though it is toxic to them
and kills them within minutes. Since {qagh} is considered
best if consumed while the worms are still alive, it is im-
portant to keep the worms out of the sauce until just be-
fore the dish is served. For the same reason, it is
customary to eat {qagh} as quickly as possible. If, for some
reason, the {qagh} cannot be consumed before they all die,
the entire mixture of {qagh} and {ghevI'} is saved and later
heated up as a sort of stew (the general term for which is
{tlhIq}; thus, {qagh tlhIq} may be translated as "{qagh}
stew"). Although not as desirable as live {qagh}, this is a
common way to serve leftovers.
     Like {qagh}, other small animals are eaten whole, in
great quantity (by the handful if possible), and, ideally,
alive. Among these are various bugs (collectively, {ghew}).
Large animals are usually chopped into pieces, some-
times with attention paid to which piece is which (thus a
{tIq} ["heart"] might be served as a dish in its own right),
sometimes not (the {ghab}, for example, is just a chunk of
the midsection of an animal, including any organs that
may have remained attached after the carving). Meat of
any kind is called {Ha'DIbaH}, which is also the normal
term for "animal" (and also an insult when used in refer-
ence to a person). Often the {DIr} ("skin") is still attached [[p.88]]
when {Ha'DIbaH} is served, though sometimes it is re-
moved and prepared as a dish in its own right.
     More sophisticated Klingon food preparation in-
volves keeping anatomically identifiable parts separate.
Some of the other commonly eaten parts include the {lem}
("hoof"), {namwech} ("paw"), {pach} ("claw"); {gham}
("limb"); {tagh} ("lung"), {burgh} ("stomach"), {luH} ("intes-
tines"), {chej} ("liver"), and other internal organs not likely
to be familiar to non-Klingons; {jat} ("tongue"); {mIn}
("eye"); {qogh} ("ear"---the external part, if there is one; the
actual organ of hearing, the {teS}, is usually considered
too small to bother with); {wuS} ("lips"), {qevpob} ("cheek,
jowl"), {ghIch} ("nose"); {Hugh} ("throat"); {Somraw} ("mus-
cle"); {QoghIj} ("brain"; another word, {yab}, also means
"brain" as an organ, but in addition it means "mind, intel-
lect" and is not used in reference to food); {to'waQ} ("liga-
ment, tendon"); {tlhuQ} ("tail"); {Hom} ("bone"); {ghISDen}
("scales"); {veD} ("fur"); and {'aD} ("vein"). Sometimes an
animal's whole head ({nach}) is served. A mixture of ani-
mal parts is {Daghtuj}, regardless of whether the parts are
from the same type of animal. Curiously, eggs ({QImmey})
do not play a large role in the Klingon diet as food items
in their own right, though they are mixed into many
sauces, usually along with the pieces of shell ({pel'aQ}),
for flavor and texture. The small eggs of the Tokvirian
skink ({toqvIr lung}), however, are often eaten whole,
shell and all, usually by the handful.
     Let us turn, appropriately briefly, from fauna to flora.
Any part of any plant that is eaten may be termed {naH},
usually translated "fruit" or "vegetable." Any nut (a fruit
with a hard shell) is called a {naHlet} (literally, "hard
fruit"), a thistle (a flower with dangerously sharp leaves)
is a {naHjej} (literally, "sharp fruit"), a bean (which, in this
case, may mean the pod or the seed or seeds in it or both)
is a {qurgh}, and a root or tuber is a {'oQqar}. Otherwise
there are no known generic names for different types of [[p.89]]
{naH} (though there are terms for specific plants and parts
of a plant). A plant's sap or juice is called {vIychorgh.}
     The outer covering of a fruit or vegetable ({yub,}
"husk, rind, peel") is always consumed, except in the case
of the {naHlet yub} ("nut shell"). Klingons typically gnaw
({choptaH}---literally, "continue biting") on the nut until it
cracks open, and then they spit out ({tlhIS}) the pieces of
shell (occasionally at a nearby diner, as a gesture of so-
ciability) before chewing and swallowing the rest. Simi-
larly, they will usually gnaw on the hard pit of some fruits
({naHnagh}--literally, "fruit stone") until it can be chewed
and swallowed, but it is not considered out of place to
treat the pit as a shell and spit out the pieces.
     Agriculture ({Satlh}) is practiced to a certain extent,
though it is common to gather uncultivated plants as
well. Fruit or vegetables that come from a farm ({Du'}) are
called either {naH} alone or {Du' naH} ("farm fruit or vege-
table," or "produce"); the wild variety is termed {naH
tlhab} (literally, "free fruit or vegetable"). The verb {yob}
("harvest") is used to refer to gathering up plants or plant
parts, whether from a field ({yotlh}) that has been sown
or out in the wild. The verb meaning "farm" is {wIj}; that
meaning "plant" (referring to vegetation of any kind) is
{poch}. One may say {Sor poch} ("He/she plants a tree"), {lav
poch} ("He/she plants a shrub"), and even {naH poch}
("He/she plants fruit or vegetables"), referring to the ulti-
mate use of the plant as a food source. Animals to be
eaten are generally acquired by means of a hunt ({chon};
the verb "hunt" is {wam}). On the other hand, Klingons
generally {Sep} ("breed") small animals such as {ghargh-
mey} ("worms").
     There is actually quite a large repertoire of food prep-
aration techniques, only a few of which are noted here.
Let us focus only on nonliving animal matter: if it is
fresh, the "cook" may {pID} it, which involves coating it
with herbed granulated cartilage (not necessarily from
the same animal) mixed with some kind of {tIr} ("grain") [[p.90]]
{{

reminds his elders of what it is to be Klingon. <Robbie Robinson>

}}
and doing very little else. The name of the granulated car-
tilage is {ngat}, which has also come to mean "gunpow-
der." Meat prepared in this way is sometimes described
as {wamwI' Ha'DIbaH} ("hunter's meat"), but the specific
animal name is usually used instead of the word {Ha'DI-
baH} ("meat"); for example, {wamwI' mIl'oD} ("hunter's
sabre bear"). If the meat is somewhat older, a common
preparation technique is to {HaH} ("marinate") it in any of
a wide variety of concoctions containing {'Iw} ("blood") [[p.91]]
and/or {vIychorgh} ("sap") as a base, along with assorted
animal parts. Meat prepared in this style is also called
{voDleH Ha'DIbaH} ("emperor's meat"), again with the
specific animal used instead of {Ha'DIbaH}; for example,
{voDleH lIngta'} ("emperor's <lingta>"). (Presumably there
was an emperor at one time who liked his meat prepared
in this fashion.) All but the least experienced cooks have
{chanDoq} ("marinade") prepared well in advance of a
meal, keeping a large container of the brew around at all
times and constantly adding new ingredients to it as they
become available. A special sauce ({qettlhup}) that accom-
panies many dishes is often a thickened version of
{chanDoq}.
     The verb {HaH}, though once restricted to this form of
food preparation, is now often used in the more general
sense of "soak, drench." It is frequently heard in the re-
flexive form ({HaH'egh,} "soak oneself") in reference to
such activities as drinking a great deal, which has posi-
tive connotations, and bathing, an occasional undertak-
ing with negative connotations.
     Almost as common as food that has been soaked in a
marinade is food that has been set aside to {rogh} ("fer-
ment"). It is important to distinguish {rogh} from {ragh}
("decay"). Food that has decayed ({raghpu'bogh Soj}, or,
more succinctly, {Soj non}---"rotten food") is food that has
become inedible and must be thrown away, though it is
sometimes given to animals. (Note that {Soj woD} ["He/
she throws the food away"], which refers to a regrettable
activity, is very different from {Soj jaD} ["He/she throws or
hurls the food in the manner of a projectile"], which,
under certain circumstances, is considered a reasonable
pastime.) To ferment food is to {roghmoH} (literally,
"cause to ferment"). Fermented meat is also known as
{qeyvaq Ha'DIbaH} ("Kayvak's food"), named, for now
forgotten reasons, after a famous ancient warrior. As
with hunter's and emperor's food, the specific meat is
used rather than the word {Ha'DIbaH} ("meat"), as in {qey- [[p.92]]
vaq lIngta'} ("Kayvak's <lingta>"). The Kayvak naming style
does not apply to fermented plants; its use is restricted to
meat.
     One way to bring fermentation about is to mix the
food with a fungus (known as {'atlhqam}) usually scraped
off the bottom of certain animals' feet, though it also
grows on trees. The fermentation process is monitored
so that the food is served at just the right time, even
though the process is actually still going on (the verb
meaning "serve fermented food at its peak" is {wech}). The
shell of an animal ({nagh DIr}---literally, "rock skin"---not
to be confused with {yub} ["husk, rind, peel"], the word
applied to the shell of a nut, or {pel'aQ} ["eggshell"]) is
commonly separated from the animal meat, fermented,
and served at another time. Finally, the way to prepare a
common dish called {qompogh} is to mash ({tap}) a mixture
of various types of {naH} ("fruit, vegetable"), with or with-
out some animal matter, into a rather lumpy paste and
then to let it {rogh} ("ferment").
     A distinctive Klingon culinary technique similar to
fermentation involves using a living animal as a food
processor. Once again, timing is critical. A number of dif-
ferent kinds of foods are mixed together, along with vari-
ous flavorful herbs, and the concoction (called {Su'lop}) is
fed to an animal. After just the right amount of time (a
good cook knows from experience when this is), the ani-
mal is killed and its parts are used for various dishes, as
would be expected. The stomach, however, still contains
the now partially digested {Su'lop}, which is removed,
used as a sauce (called {quD}), and served with great
flourish. To prepare a sauce in this manner is described
as {Su'lop Suqqa'} (literally, "reacquire {Su'lop}," often
shortened to just {Suqqa'}. There is an alternate way of [[}.:=}).]]
preparing {quD} that involves using chemicals to do the
job of the animal's stomach enzymes. Klingon gourmets
distinguish between the two by referring to {quD} made
in the natural way as {burgh quD} ("stomach {quD}"), as [[p.93]]
opposed to the artificially produced {'un quD} ("pot {quD}").
Though nutritionally identical, {burgh quD}, when avail-
able, is always preferable to {'un quD}.
     If heat is used as part of food preparation, the cook
is most likely to {mIQ} ("deep-fry") the food. This involves
first acquiring {tlhagh} ("animal fat") from any available
source and then heating it up so that it boils (the general
word for "boil" is {pub}, but the verb used specifically to
refer to the boiling of fat is {'Im} ["render"]). After it has
been boiling for a while, the food to be fried is tossed in
(sometimes having been coated in some kind of paste),
and it stays there until it has soaked up as much of the
{tlhagh} ("fat") as possible. A particularly popular dish,
{tlhombuS}, requires that the cook coat a block of {tlhagh}
with a mixture of {ngat} ("herbed granulated cartilage")
and {tIr} ("grain") and then briefly immerse the block into
the already boiling fat, just until the coating hardens.
     Some dishes are prepared by heating meat in a liquid
consisting of the animal's blood along with some choice
condiments. To prepare food in this way is to {Qev} it. Liv-
ers of <bokrats> are typically prepared in this manner.
Though the dish is heated, in order to properly make
{boqrat chej Qevlu'pu'bogh} ("stewed <bokrat> liver"; liter-
ally, <"bokrat> liver that has been stewed"), the livers should
be from an animal that was killed only minutes before.
The difference in flavor between fresh and nearly stale
livers is most noticeable.
     Another popular dish, {qul DIr} ("fire skin"), is made
by soaking cut up pieces of animal skin, from whatever
animal is available, in a strong liquor, then removing
them from the solution and setting them afire just before
serving. The dish is eaten quickly, while the pieces are
still burning.
     It is also not unusual to {HaH} ("marinate") or {rogh-
moH} ("ferment") various sorts of {naH} ("fruit, vegeta-
ble"). One common dish is a torpedo-shaped fruit called
{peb'ot,} which is soaked in a {chanDoq} ("marinade"). The [[p.94]]
fully marinated {peb'ot} is called a {Hurgh}. Experienced
cooks will {mIQ} ("fry") the {DIghna' por} (<"digna> leaf"),
though this is risky, since if the leaf is heated for too long,
it will wilt.
     Certain dishes are typically prepared in certain ways,
so it is not necessary to describe the preparation tech-
nique when naming it; the name of the plant, animal, or
animal part is enough. Thus, {pIpyuS pach} (<"pipius>
claw") is always prepared the same way; it would be pe-
culiar to hear {pIpyuS pach HaHlu'pu'bogh} (<"pipius>
claw that has been marinated; marinated <pipius> claw"),
since such phrasing would be redundant. By contrast,
the claw of the <ka'raj> is prepared in a variety of ways,
so saying that dinner will consist of {qa'raj pach} (<"ka'raj>
claw") is not giving enough information. If a dish with
a standard preparation technique (a {nay' motlh}, "usual
dish") is being offered, asking how it is to be prepared is
a demonstration of cultural ignorance. Thus, in addition
to <pipius> claw, questions about {bIreQtagh} (<"bregit>
lung"), {targh tIq} ("heart of <targ">), {raHta'} ("racht"),
{tlhImqaH} (<"zilm'kach">), and {Qaj tlhuQ} (<"kradge> tail")
should be avoided. On the other hand, asking whether
the {quD} is naturally produced ({burgh quD}) or the artifi-
cially produced type ({'un quD}) or specifying whether one
prefers {tlhatlh} (<"gladst">) with or without sauce shows
both knowledge of and interest in Klingon cuisine.
     Klingon drinks may be divided into two types: those
with and those without an intoxicating effect---basically,
those with and those without alcohol. There is no known
noun referring to drinks in general (though, as noted
above, beverages are considered a type of {Soj} ["food"]).
Any alcoholic beverage is called {HIq}. Federation Stan-
dard makes a distinction between the various forms of
liquor; Klingon does not. Thus, the word {HIq} is trans-
lated in various ways in names of different drinks, partic-
ularly, though not exclusively, those of non-Klingon
origin: {romuluS HIq} ("Romulan ale") {'Iw HIq} ("blood- [[p.95]]
wine"), {Sorya' HIq} ("Saurian brandy"). On the other
hand, many native Klingon alcoholic drinks have names
that do not contain the word {HIq}. Among these are {wor-
nagh} (<"warnog">), a kind of ale; {baqghol} (<"bahgol">), con-
sumed heated and out of rather small glasses; and
the very strong {chechtlhutlh} (<"chech'tluth">). (The fact
that {chechtlhutlh} seems to be made up of two verbs re-
lated to drinking---{chech} ["be drunk"] and {tlhutlh}
["drink"]---is no doubt coincidental.) Imported alcoholic
beverages are made of various ingredients, some of them
not available in the Klingon Empire. Domestic {HIq} is
distilled from a number of different kinds of grain ({tIr}),
with some additional constituents (of both plant and ani-
mal origin, including {'Iw}, "blood") adding flavor and
strength. {'Iw HIq} ("bloodwine") is served warm to hot
(best is {porgh Hat}---{"}body temperature," though it is not [[{"}:="]]
clear whose body) and should be very dark red in color.
Drinking {HIq} is usually accompanied by toasting.
     There are a number of common nonalcoholic drinks
(though no single word refers to the entire collection of
them). As already pointed out, any drink made of the liq-
uid that circulates through any part of a plant is {vIy-
chorgh} ("juice"). Animal blood ({'Iw}) is found primarily
in alcoholic beverages, but the milk ({nIm}) of some crea-
tures (such as the {targh} [<"targ">]) is combined with other
ingredients to form drinks of rather complex flavor,
though it is seldom consumed by itself. A popular effer-
vescent drink, black in color, is called {'awje'}. This is fre-
quently, though not accurately, translated as "root beer,"
probably because of its superficial resemblance to the
Federation soft drink, but it is made from, among other
things, the marrow ({melchoQ}) taken from the bones of
a {teghbat} (<"teg'bat">). It is considered relatively mild, even
for a Klingon nonalcoholic drink.
     Though not native to the Empire, Klingons have de-
veloped a way to make coffee ({qa'vIn}) particularly
strong, both in flavor and in its effect as a stimulant, and [[p.96]]
it is a very popular beverage. As a rule, coffee is con-
sumed plain---that is, black---but some Klingons prefer
to mix other ingredients in with the coffee. If some kind
of {HIq} ("liquor") is added to the coffee, the drink is called
{ra'taj}. It is said that the drink was originally nicknamed
{ra'wI' taj} ("commander's knife," suggestive of its po-
tency), and that the name was shortened over time. This
often repeated story cannot be confirmed. In any event,
{ra'taj} became one of the few Klingon foods to become
popular outside of the Empire, though in an altered
form. Instead of containing liquor, as does the genuine
Klingon {ra'taj}, the "export" version (which came to be
pronounced <raktaj> in Federation Standard) consists of
strong Klingon coffee plus a nutlike flavoring. Eventu-
ally, a new fashion developed---adding cream to the <rak-
taj>---and with this innovation came yet another name,
<raktajino>, modeled after the name of another popular
coffee drink, cappuccino. <Raktajino> is now served hot or
iced, with or without extra cream, and with or without
the rind of some fruit to add even more flavor. Though it
is sometimes called "Klingon coffee," it is quite different
from both plain {qa'vIn} and the alcoholic {ra'taj}.
     Tea ({Dargh}) is another common Klingon beverage.
There are many types of tea, some based on vegetable
matter, some on animal. The word {Dargh} refers to the
beverage only. If plants or animal parts are dried and,
if necessary, chopped up before being steeped in boiling
water to produce {Dargh}, this preparation is called {Qen-
vob}. Often, however, there is no {Qenvob}; the tea is made
by simply picking thorns, leaves, petals, or seeds off of
a plant and immediately immersing them in the water.
Usually brackish water ({bIQ na'}) is best. Tea may be
made either in a teapot ({runpI'}) or directly in the teacup
({Dargh HIvje',} or, if not a cup specifically designed for
drinking tea, just {HIvje'}).
     Though one may drink tea at any time, Klingons ob-
serve a very solemn Tea Ceremony in which a tea that [[p.97]]
is somewhat toxic (for a Klingon---but quite deadly for
humans) is both prepared and consumed according to
certain ritualistic procedures. During the Tea Ceremony,
two friends drink the tea partly as a test of bravery and
partly as a reminder of the Klingon maxim that "death is
an experience best shared."
     The equipment needed for the preparation of Klin-
gon food is rather minimal, consisting pretty much of
pots or vats plus cutting and stirring implements of vari-
ous sorts. The general term for a pot is {'un}. Pots that may
be put on top of a fire in order to heat their contents are
made of metal ({baS}); others may be made of either metal
or ceramic material ({nagh} [literally, "stone"]). A {bargh} is
probably the most frequently used pot. It is rather large
and has a flattened bottom. The smaller {nevDagh} is char-
acterized by its V-shaped handles, termed {DeSqIvDu'}
("elbows"; note that {-Du'}, the plural suffix for body parts,
is used here even though the handles are not literally
body parts). A square or rectangular tub used to hold
food while it is fermenting is called a {'Ib}, and a cook's
ever-present supply of {chanDoq} ("marinade") is kept in
a large {bal} ("jug, jar, bottle").
     If the food must be cut up before cooking or eating,
a knife ({taj}) is used, though, as noted earlier, the knives
used for this purpose are different from those used as
weapons. Food-preparation knives, of which there are
many types, come in different sizes and shapes for differ-
ent cutting tasks. For example, a {warjun} is a large, ex-
tremely sharp, square-bladed chopping implement (but
for its short handle, it would probably be considered a
kind of {'obmaQ} ["ax"]). For finer work (such as making
the slits in limbs needed to extract veins), a small {SIjwI'}
(literally, "slitter") is commonly employed. A general, all- [[keep hyphen]]
purpose knife that seems to be able to cut through practi-
cally anything is a {'aqnaw}.
     The stick used for stirring in a {'un} ("pot") is usually
called a {DuDwI'} ("mixer"), though sometimes the term [[p.98]]
{{

[[image]]

Gowron lifts his {HIvje'}. <Brian D. McLaughlin>

}}
{'un naQ} ("pot cane") is heard. If the end of the {DuDwI'}
is flattened out, paddlelike, the device may also be called
a {ngawDeq}. A scooping implement, much like a garden
trowel, used to remove food from a pot, is a {bo'Dagh}.
     A container from which drinks are consumed is a
{HIvje'}. This word is used for any sort of drinking vessel:
glass, cup, mug, stein, goblet, tumbler, and so on. If nec-
essary, {HIvje'} can also be used to refer to drinking vessels
normally not associated with Klingon culture---for exam-
ple, crystal stemware. Since certain drinks are typically
associated with certain containers, saying the type of
drink plus {HIvje'} indicates the type of cup or glass as
well: {'Iw HIq HIvje'} ("bloodwine glass"), {qa'vIn HIvje'}
("coffee mug"), {baqghol HIvje'} (<"bahgol> cup"). Unless
specified further, {HIq HIvje'} ("liquor glass") usually
means a tankard or stein for beer or ale. A {bal} is any bot- [[p.99]]
tle or jug used to store liquid. Usually one will pour
({qang}) the drink directly from the {bal} into the {HIvje'}, but
it is not considered uncivil to drink directly from the {bal}.
Ale is often stored in a large vat ({qegh}) rather than in a
{bal}. Some drinks are served in special containers, such as
the {runpI'} ("teapot") used in the making of {Dargh} ("tea"),
and are then poured into the appropriate {HIvje'}.
     Each dish is brought to the table ({raS}) on a platter
({'elpI'}), usually made of metal. The food is arranged not
haphazardly but in a way that helps the food look appeal-
ing. For example, in some dishes, pieces are placed with
the veins clearly visible so that the blood still inside them
can be seen. A diner transfers a portion to his or her plate
({jengva'}, though the plural form is {ngop} ["plates"]), if
one is available, by simply grabbing the desired quantity
of food with a hand. If the {'elpI'} ("serving platter") is not
close by, it is quite acceptable to just reach across the
table or to walk around the table to a more convenient
position. If necessary, two hands may be used to break
off ({wItlh}) a slab of the desired fare. If {ngop} ("plates")
are provided, they will probably be in a pile somewhere
on the table. It is acceptable to reach over and grab one;
it is not acceptable to ask someone else to grab a plate
and pass it down. If there is no pile of plates, none will
be furnished, and it is quite improper to ask for one.
     Eating is done with hands only. There is no Klingon
fork or spoon. If the cook has prepared the food properly,
there should be no need to use a knife either, though,
from time to time, one is quite useful. If the particular
dish is somewhat soupy (a dish of this kind is termed a
{chatlh}, roughly translated as "soup," though the amount
of liquid is far less than what the Federation Standard
term "soup" would suggest), it will arrive at the table in a
large bowl ({maHpIn}) and a diner will pour its contents
into a smaller bowl ({Duq}), from which he or she will con-
sume it. Since this sort of dish is still primarily solid food
as opposed to liquid, using the verb {tlhutlh} ("drink") to [[p.100]]
describe ingesting it is not quite right. There is another
verb, {'ep}, which refers to eating food of this kind.
     When the food arrives, it should be eaten as is; noth-
ing equivalent to a saltshaker will be found on a Klingon
dining table. On the other hand, if a dish comes with a
sauce, it is appropriate to use as much or as little sauce
as one desires.
     Klingons tend to eat quickly, taking rather large
amounts of food into their mouths and swallowing in big
gulps. This is true of food eaten at any of the four daily
meals ({nIQ} ["breakfast"], {megh} ["lunch"], {'uQ} ["din-
ner"], and {ghem} [usually translated as "midnight snack,"
but really a late-night meal of some substance]), as well
as food eaten at any other time. Unless one is dining
alone, a meal is typically quite noisy, with a great deal of
talking (and often singing) accompanying the clattering
of plates and bowls. This is particularly true of a {'uQ'a'}
("banquet, feast"; literally, "great dinner" or "big dinner,"
but used regardless of the time of day of the banquet). By
the end of the meal, there should be a good amount of
food scattered all about, mostly as a result of food spill-
ing or dropping as it makes its way from various plates
and platters to mouths. Indeed, if one eats too neatly or
if one does not eat with gusto, it will probably be as-
sumed that one is not enjoying the food. (The verb {noS}
["eat in small mouthfuls, nibble"], unless applied to small
animals or very young children, is always used derogato-
rily.) Also, at the end of a meal, one should avoid picking
bits of food out of one's teeth. To do so is to insult the
cook by implying that the food was not well prepared and
that the eater wants to get the flavors out of his mouth.
     Any visitor to a Klingon city, or even outpost, will un-
doubtedly want to spend some time sampling Klingon
food in a restaurant ({Qe'}). Reservations are not accepted,
and the means of payment is arranged upon being shown
a table. Tipping is unknown. In some restaurants, the
menu ({HIDjolev}) is posted (seldom are individual copies [[p.101]]
{{

}}
available), but in most, the patrons know the regular fare
and ask about specials, including the {DaHjaj gheD} (liter-
ally, "today's prey"), a dish whose components depend on
what animals the restaurant's hunters were able to bring
in. The person who takes the order and brings the food is
the {jabwI'} ("server") and the chef is the {vutwI'} ("cook"; in
a large restaurant, the head chef is referred to as the
{vutwI' quv,} the "honored cook"). In small establishments,
the {jabwI'} and {vutwI'} are likely to be the same individual.
If there is a separate bar ({tach}), the bartender ({chom}) will
mix drinks; otherwise, these chores fall to the {vutwI'}.
     When taking a table's order, the {jabwI'} neither writes
anything down nor enters data into a computer. It is con-
sidered the duty of the {jabwI'} to remember ({qaw}) the
choices and to bring the correct food, and servers tend to
be quite skilled at this. On the rare occasion when the [[p.102]]
{jabwI'} has remembered incorrectly ({qawHa'}), the pa-
tron may reject ({lajQo'}) the dish. If the patron rejects a
dish that the server believes has been properly remem-
bered, however, the misunderstanding could develop
into minor combat. For most of the other diners in the
restaurant, this is regarded as an exhilarating diversion.
     The actual eating of a meal at a restaurant is done in
accordance with the same rules of etiquette as any other
meal, as described earlier. If anything additional is de-
sired during the meal---more food or drink, for exam-
ple---the server is called over by shouting {jabwI'!}
("Server!") If a refill of the drink order is all that is
needed, some time can be saved by adding {wI'oj} ("We're [[wI'oj:=ma'oj]]
thirsty") to the shout. By the end of the meal, all of the
ordered food should be gone (except, for, of course,
whatever may have been spilled, dropped, or thrown).
{Soj chuv} ("leftover food") is rare unless all members of a
dining party were called away midmeal.
     If the restaurant is large enough to have a separate bar
({tach}), the dining party, upon completion of the meal, is
likely to move to the bar and continue drinking and, prob-
ably, toasting and singing. In a smaller establishment, din-
ers tend to remain at the table for quite a while.
     Some restaurants post a sign reading {moD Soj} (liter-
ally, "the food hurries"). This means that the restaurant,
sometimes called a {Do Qe'} (literally, "velocity restau-
rant"), caters to those who have a limited amount of time
to eat before returning to their various duties. In such
an establishment, the menu is limited and changes quite
infrequently. Orders are given and taken quickly, and lin-
gering is uncommon. Each dish is prepared and served
in one way and one way only, so it is inappropriate, for
example, to say whether sauce is desired. The person tak-
ing the order is, in this case, called not a {jabwI'} ("server")
but, instead, a {tebwI'} (literally, "filler"), presumably be-
cause he or she fills a platter ({'elpI'}) with the requested
food. Customers, even those who have never been in the [[p.103]]
{{

establishment before, are assumed to be familiar with all
details of the fare and procedures. It is not uncommon
for a {tebwI'} to become a bit testy (a subtle change in
temperament, to be sure) if a customer hesitates or asks
questions while giving an order. Other customers will
probably show their annoyance as well. A regular patron
of a {Do Qe'} tends to order the same dishes on each visit.
     At many restaurants, it is possible to order food pack-
aged in boxes to be eaten elsewhere. This sort of food is
called {leng Soj} ("voyage food"). The term {leng} ("voyage")
may be applied to any specific meal---for example, {leng
megh} ("voyage lunch"). It is unwise to order a dish that
should be eaten live as {leng Soj}. [[p.104]]

IDIOMS

Klingon culture is known as a rather straightforward
one in which people speak in a forthright manner,
saying exactly what they mean and never using an indi-
rect expression when a blunt one will do. When a Federa-
tion citizen on Earth says "It's rather chilly in this room,"
he or she may really mean "I am uncomfortably cold and
want somebody to close the window." The Klingon sen-
tence {pa'vamDaq jIbIr} means "I am cold in this room"
({pa'vamDaq,} "in this room"; {jIbIr,} "I am cold")---nothing
more, nothing less. If it is desirable to close the window,
the Klingon will simply say, {Qorwagh yISoQmoH}
("Close the window!"; {Qorwagh,} "window"; {yISoQmoH,}
"Close it!"). Similarly, if a Klingon wants to know some-
thing, he or she may simply demand that the information
be given. For example, a common way to say "Which
weapon do you want?" is not as a question at all but in-
stead as a command: {nuH DaneHbogh yIngu'!} (literally,
"Identify the weapon that you want!"; {nuH,} "weapon";
{DaneHbogh,} "that you want"; {yIngu',} "Identify it!").
     On the other hand, there are a great many Klingon
expressions that, interpreted literally, are likely to make
little or no sense to a non-Klingon visitor. For example,
the Klingon phrase {wa' DoS wIqIp} ("We hit one target")
or the shorter {DoS wIqIp} ("We hit a target"; {wa',} "one";
{DoS,} "target"; {wIqIp,} "We hit it") is frequently heard in [[p.106]]
conversations that have nothing to do with shooting, tar-
gets, or even weaponry. It is a way of saying "We agree."
By the same token, {cha' DoSmey DIqIp} ("We hit two
targets") or the shorter {DoSmey DIqIp} ("We hit targets";
{cha',} "two"; {DoSmey,} "targets"; {DIqIp,} "We hit them")
normally means "We disagree."
     These expressions that cannot be interpreted prop-
erly from the individual meanings of their components
are <idioms>, and they are used just frequently enough in
everyday Klingon that a visitor needs to be aware of at
least some of them. To understand an idiom, one must
learn the phrase as a whole. In using an idiom, one must
repeat it exactly; paraphrases will be interpreted literally,
not in the idiomatic sense. Thus, in the last example
above, the word for "targets" must be {DoSmey} ({DoS,}
"target," plus {-mey,} "plural"), never {ray'}, an inherently
plural noun meaning "targets." The phrase {ray' wIqIp}
means only "We hit targets"; it would never be interpre-
ted as having anything to do with agreeing or not agree-
ing. (Inherently plural nouns like {ray'} are grammatically
singular, so the verb form is {wIqIp}---literally, "we hit
it"---rather than {DIqIp,} "We hit them".) Incidentally, the
word {DoSmey} brings with it connotations of "scattered
all about," so {DoSmey DIqIp} really means something
like "We hit scattered targets," an image that fits the idio-
matic meaning of "We disagree" quite well.
     It is important to note that an idiom usually cannot
be translated from one language into another and carry
with it the same meaning. Thus, to a speaker of Federa-
tion Standard, "We hit a target" conveys information
only about hitting a target and has nothing to do with
agreeing. By the same token, literally translating a
sentence such as "The restaurant changed hands" into
Klingon, presumably as {ghopDu' choHpu' Qe'} ("The
restaurant has altered hands") or perhaps {ghopDu'
tampu' Qe'} ("The restaurant has exchanged hands";
{ghopDu',} "hands"; {choHpu',} "has altered, has changed"; [[p.107]]
{Qe',} "restaurant"; {tampu',} "has exchanged"), does not
tell the Klingon that the restaurant is now under new
ownership, which is what the Federation Standard
phrase really means. Assuming that a restaurant can do
anything at all (which it probably cannot---only a being
of some sort can do something), the only meaning a Klin-
gon would glean from these sentences is that the restau-
rant acquired hands (meaning only body parts) that it
previously did not have. Even given Klingon cuisine, this
would be highly unusual. Idioms are very much language
(and culture) specific.
     Among the common Klingon idioms are some
phrases taken from mythology and literature. For ex-
ample, the expression {Hoch jaghpu'Daj HoHpu'} ("He/
she has killed all his/her enemies"; {Hoch,} "all"; {jaghpu- [[pu:=pu']]
'Daj,} "his/her enemies"; {HoHpu',} "He/she has killed [['Daj:=Daj]]
them") is used to describe a person who is leading a
meaningless, empty life, one lacking any challenge. It
is derived from a line in the poem "{lu qeng}" ("The
Fall of Kang"; literally, "Kang falls") by G'trok: {Hoch
jaghpu'Daj HoHbogh SuvwI' yIvup}, the classic Feder-
ation Standard translation of which is "Pity the warrior
who slays all his foes."
     Normally, an idiom follows the rules of Klingon
grammar (for example, the verb takes the prefix appro-
priate to the meaning intended), but occasionally, one
will be grammatically aberrant. Thus, the phrase {mIv je
DaS} (literally, "helmet and boot") is used to mean fully
dressed, as for a ceremonial affair (as in {mIv je DaS tuQ
ra'wI'} ("The commander wears helmet and boot"---that [[(:=[]]
is, "The commander is in full dress uniform"). Normally, [[):=])]]
the conjunction {je} ("and") would be expected to follow
the second noun (here, {DaS} ["boot"]), but in this phrase,
it does not. The grammatically correct {mIv DaS je} also
means "helmet and boot," but it would not be used in the
sense of full dress. The sentence {mIv DaS je tuQ ra'wI'}
would mean simply "The commander is wearing a hel- [[p.108]]
met and a boot" (or, since the plural need never be
overtly indicated, perhaps this would mean "The com-
mander is wearing a helmet and boots"). How the odd
grammatical construction came to be is not known with
certainty, but it probably is based on an older form of
the language. The fact that the expression for "full dress"
includes the word {mIv} "helmet" also suggests that the
phrase has been in use for a long time, since helmets are
no longer commonly part of Klingon attire. Finally, it is
important to note that the idiomatic expression is always
{mIv je DaS} ("helmet and boot"), never {DaS je mIv} ("boot
and helmet"). As is frequently the case in idioms, the
order of elements cannot be changed.
     Klingons are sometimes aware of the source of an
expression, as is the case with the line from G'trok just
noted, but more often the origin of the phrase is known
only to scholars or is lost altogether. In the list that fol-
lows, the sources or probable sources of the idioms are
given when possible. There are a great many idioms
other than the ones in this list (some are cited elsewhere
in this book), but the collection here should give the visi-
tor a good start on speaking the language in a way that
sounds natural.


COMMON IDIOMS

     {ngaQ lojmIt.} ("The door is locked.")

     This phrase has two meanings: (1) "The situation has
an unavoidable outcome"; (2) "The plan or commitment
is firm and cannot be changed." A door ({lojmIt}, though
this word may also be translated as "gate") is a symbol of
escape, so a door that is locked ({ngaQ}) means there is no
escape or no way out.

     {Hoch nuH qel} ("consider every weapon")

     This is an idiom cloaked in the terminology of the
military that has a wider application. It is used to mean [[p.109]]
{{

}}
"Consider every possibility" or "Consider every option,"
with the word {nuH} ("weapon") standing metaphorically
for "possibility." ({Hoch} means "all, every" and {qel} is
"consider, take into account.") It is not a set phrase, so it
is heard in various forms, such as a command ({Hoch
nuH yIqel!---}literally, "Consider every weapon!" but [[---}:=}---]]
meaning "Consider every possibility!"), question ({Hoch
nuH Daqel'a'?} ["Did you consider every weapon?"]), or
statement ({Hoch nuH wIqelpu'} ["We've considered
every weapon"]), and it can be negated ({Hoch nuH
qelbe'} ["He/she does not consider every weapon"]). The [[p.110]]
regular word for "possibility" is {DuH}, and, grammati-
cally, there is no reason it could not occur instead of {nuH}
in these sentences ({Hoch DuH yIqel} ["Consider every
possibility!"] is a perfectly well formed sentence), but this
is simply not the normal way to express the advice. The
use of {nuH} ("weapon") for {DuH} ("possibility") may have
been influenced by the Krotmag dialect pronunciation of
{DuH} as something very close to {nuH} (see The Fiction of
Klingon Conformity, under "Pronunciation," pages 18--
23). [[>>link]]

     {qul DIr yISop!} ("Eat the fire skin!")

     This phrase means "Hurry up! Move quickly!" It
comes from the necessity of eating {qul DIr} ("fire skin"),
a dish consisting of flaming pieces of cut-up animal skin,
quickly, before the fire goes out.

     {naH jajmey} ("vegetable days")

     The phrase "vegetable days" (or "fruit days," since
{naH} means both "vegetable" and "fruit") refers to one's
youth, a time before reaching an age considered appro-
priate for marriage. The imagery is of a plant, rooted but
growing, just as a Klingon youth still needs grounding
(the home) for nourishment (teaching) in order to grow
spiritually. The phrase is used in sentences such as {naH
jajmeywIj betleH vIyanbe'} ("In my vegetable days, I did
not wield a <bat'leth">; {naH jajmeywIj,} "my vegetable
days"; {betleH,} <"bat'leth">; {vIyanbe',} "I do not wield it").
This expression was actually first heard in a speech in
the original Klingon version of Shakespeare's "{'antonI'
tlhI'yopatra' je}" in which the heroine refers to her own
youth in this way. In the popular Federation Standard
version of this play, {naH} is translated as "salad." [[?? act 1: scene 5]]

     {qutluch patlh} (<"kut'luch> rank")

     This phrase means "hierarchical structure." The <kut'-
luch> is a knife associated with Klingon assassins, so the [[p.111]]
imagery is one of a list, presumably in a specific order, of
intended victims of the <kut'luch>. To determine one's place
in Klingon society or to understand who has authority
over whom, one must be aware of the {qutluch patlh} of
the military, the government, the house with which one
is associated, and so on.

     {ngem Sarghmey tlha'} ("chase forest <sarks">)

     A Klingon <sark> ({Sargh}) is an animal somewhat re-
sembling a Terran horse, both in appearance and in
that Klingons (generally individually) often ride on the
animal's back. A "forest <sark"> ({ngem Sargh}) is a <sark>
found in the forest ({ngem})---that is, in the wild, usually
one that has never carried a Klingon around. A Klingon
game played on <sark>back involves one rider and <sark>
executing a particular maneuver, and then the other
players copying this maneuver. The idea is to make the
movement somewhat erratic---in the manner of a wild,
not a domesticated animal---so that it is difficult to
duplicate. In other words, the players all follow or
chase ({tlha'}) the lead rider on his or her wild <sark.> The
phrase (often in the form {ngem Sarghmey tlha'laH}
["be able to chase forest <sarks">] ) is now used to indi- [[] ):=])]]
cate that one is capable of following anyone or any-
thing---that is, that one is capable of understanding
even the most complex of discussions or of solving the
most intricate of problems.

     {vIHtaH gho.} ("The hoop is moving.")

     This expression means that an activity of finite
(though perhaps indeterminate) length has started. It is
used to encourage somebody to make a decision or to
perform a process more quickly. The implication is that
the activity will soon end, so that one should be sure to
do whatever is required before it is too late, before the
opportunity passes. The phrase might be used, for exam-
ple, after a ship has been attacked. The captain might [[p.112]]
say, {vIHtaH gho} ("The hoop is moving"), meaning the
battle has begun and it is time for each warrior to play
his part. On the other hand, it may be used to ask a friend
to join one for a dinner that has already started: {bISop
DaneH'a'? vIHtaH gho} ("Do you want to eat? The hoop
is moving"). In other words, "If you want to eat, say so
now before the food is gone." The expression comes from
a maneuver used for hunting practice known as the
{qa'vaQ} in which a hoop ({gho}) is rolled and one tries to
throw a stick through it while it is moving. The verb {vIH}
("move, be in motion") can be applied to any sort of mo-
tion. In this case, it refers to the motion associated with
the hoop in this exercise, namely rolling. In the idiom,
the verb occurs with the suffix {-taH} ("continuous"), im-
plying that the hoop continues to roll for a period of time
(though it will not do so forever).

     {pe'vIl bI'chu'} ("forcefully sweep away")

     The verb {bI'} ("sweep") refers to the action of pushing
something out of the way by using an implement or the
forearm as if it were a broom. If whatever is pushed is
cleared away completely, one is said to {bI'chu'} ("sweep
[something] away"; literally, "sweep perfectly"). In the
Mekro'vak region, for example, a common courtship rit-
ual requires the male to use the leg of a <lingta> to force-
fully ({pe'vIl}) sweep away ({bI'chu'}) whatever is on the
dinner table before declaring his feelings to the female.
In addition to its literal interpretation, the phrase has
come to mean "do something all at once, as a single
event." It is used in such constructions as {romuluS-
nganpu' Dujmey DIQaw'pu'; pe'vIl DIbI'chu'pu'} ("We
destroyed the Romulans' ships all at once"; {romuluS-
gnanpu',} "Romulans"; {Dujmey,} "ships"; {DIQaw'pu',} [[gnan:=ngan]]
"We have destroyed them"; {pe'vIl,} "forcefully"; {DIbI'-
chu'pu',} "We have swept them away"; thus, literally,
"We've destroyed the Romulans' ships; we've forcefully
swept them away"). [[p.113]]

     {mevyap!} ("Stop, [it is] enough!")

     This expression, usually considered a single word, is
used as a command meaning "Stop! Cease!" It comes
from two Klingon verbs, {mev} ("stop, cease") and {yap} ("be
enough, be sufficient"). No doubt in the past, the locution
was longer, perhaps {yImev, yap!} ("Stop! It is enough!")
Actually, {yImev!} ("Stop!") is the imperative form if the
command is given to an individual; to tell a group to stop,
one would say {pemev!} The dropping of the imperative
prefix ({yI-} or {pe-}) is what would be expected in Clipped
Klingon, the abbreviated form of the language frequently
used in giving military orders or when under duress; {yap}
("be enough") is used as if an exclamation or a single- [[keep hyphen]]
word sentence meaning "It is enough." The two words
have been used in juxtaposition ({mev, yap}) for so long,
they have come to be accepted as a single, though gram-
matically peculiar, word. If the order of the components
were reversed ({yapmev}), the utterance would be mean-
ingless.

     {vaj Duj chIj} ("navigate a warrior ship")

     This is a way to say "have strength of character." This
sense clearly came about because of the existence in
Klingon of two words pronounced {Duj}, one meaning
"ship, vessel," the other meaning "instincts." If {Duj} is
taken in its "ship" sense, then {vaj Duj} means "warrior
ship," something that is certainly appropriate to navigate
({chIj}). On the other hand, if {Duj} is taken to mean "in-
stincts," then {vaj Duj} means "warrior instincts" and the
phrase {vaj Duj chIj} ("navigate warrior instincts") makes
no sense unless interpreted idiomatically. To a Klingon,
this would be to set and direct the course or use of these
instincts---that is, to be in control of them. The phrase
{vaj Duj} ("warrior vessel" or "warrior instincts"), even
without the verb {chIj} ("navigate"), is taken to mean
"strength of character," though it can also be used liter- [[p.114]]
{{

}}
ally. It is noteworthy that in this idiom the word for "war-
rior" is not the frequently heard {SuvwI'}, which would
denote an individual warrior, but rather is {vaj}, which re-
fers to the whole idea of being a warrior. Thus, when {Duj}
is taken to mean "instincts," {vaj Duj} refers to the in-
stincts associated with being a warrior or the instincts
needed for combat; {SuvwI' Duj} would mean the instincts
of a specific warrior. If {Duj} is taken to mean "ship," {vaj
Duj} ("warrior ship") would suggest that the ship itself
has the characteristics of a warrior, a perfectly reason-
able notion. To express that a ship is that of a specific
warrior, the word {SuvwI'} is appropriate: {SuvwI' Duj} [[p.115]]
("warrior's ship"). The idiom, referring to strength of
character, may be used in sentences such as {vaj Duj
DachIj} ("You navigate a warrior ship"---that is, "You
have strength of character") or {vaj Duj chIjbe'} ("He/she
does not navigate a warrior ship"---that is, "He/she lacks
strength of character").

     {Dujmey law' chIjpu'} ("has navigated many
          ships")

     This expression means "be experienced." It is similar
to the previous one in that it is phrased in terms of the
navigation of ships. This time, {Duj} (here in its plural
form {Dujmey}) means only "ship," not "instincts," and the
focus is on the fact that someone has navigated ({chIjpu'})
many ({law'}) of them, presumably successfully. To have
navigated many ships is to have gained a great deal of
experience. When used, the subject of the sentence is the
person who is being characterized as experienced: {Duj-
mey law' DachIjpu'} ("You have navigated many ships"---
that is, "You are experienced").

     {jop 'ej way'} ("lunge and deflect")

     This idiom, which means "have an argument," is
based on movements associated with the <bat'leth.> During
the course of a bout, both parties, among other things,
alternately lunge ({jop}), that is, push the <bat'leth> toward
the opponent, and deflect ({way'}), or use the <bat'leth> to
push the oncoming one away. Each side, then, engages
in both offensive and defensive movements, and this al-
ternation of roles is likened to a verbal duel. In using the
expression, the appropriate verbal affixes are attached;
for example, {wIjoppu' 'ej wIway'pu'} ("We have lunged
and we have deflected"---that is, "We have had an argu-
ment"). If the two verbs are reversed ({way' 'ej jop} ["de-
flect and lunge"]), the idea of "have an argument" is not
present, though the phrase is perfectly well formed if re-
ferring to a <bat'leth> bout. [[p.116]]

     {pollaH pagh polHa'laH} ("can either keep it or
          discard it")

     This is a way to say "The matter is unimportant" or
"It does not make any difference." The phrase is usually
used in response to someone who expresses a concern
about something, and the "it" in the translation refers to [[p.117]]
the matter under discussion. It is sometimes phrased in
terms of the speaker, as in {vIpollaH pagh vIpolHa'laH}
("I can either keep it or I can discard it"; {vIpollaH,} "I can
keep it"; {pagh,} "or"; {vIpolHa'laH,} "I can discard it"), or
the listener, as in {DapollaH pagh DapolHa'laH} ("You
can either keep it or you can discard it").

     {ghe'torvo' narghDI' qa'pu'} ("when spirits
          escape from Gre'thor")

     According to mythology, when a dishonored Klingon
dies, his or her spirit goes to a place called Gre'thor, there
to remain. To speak of spirits escaping from Gre'thor is
to speak of an impossibility. The phrase usually follows
the statement of what it is that supposedly cannot hap-
pen: {jIjegh ghe'torvo' narghDI' qa'pu'} ("I will surrender
when spirits escape from Gre'thor"; {jIjegh,} "I surrender";
{ghe'torvo',} "from Gre'thor"; {narghDI',} "when they es-
cape"; {qa'pu',} "spirits"). Note that the word for "spirit,"
{qa'}, takes the plural suffix {-pu',} which is used for beings
capable of using language. Spirits do speak.

     {yItaD!} or {petaD!} ("Be frozen!")

     These are idiomatic ways to give the command
"Don't move!" The word {yItaD} is used when speaking to
an individual; {petaD} is used when giving the command
to a group. The verb {taD} means "be frozen," and it is used
here in a peculiar, though not really ungrammatical, way.
Generally, when a verb describing a state of being (for
example, {tuj} ["be hot"]) is used in the imperative form,
the suffixes {-'egh} (reflexive suffix) and {-moH} ("cause")
are used as well: {yItuj'eghmoH} ("Heat yourself!"---that [[yItuj'eghmoH:=yItuj'eghmoH!]]
is, "Cause yourself to be hot!"), {yItaD'eghmoH!} ("Freeze
yourself!"---that is, "Cause yourself to be frozen!"). When
{taD} is used in the idiomatic sense of "not move," how-
ever, it is treated as if a verb describing an activity, such
as {yIt} ("walk"): {yIyIt!} ("Walk!"). [[p.118]]

     {qagh HoH} ("kill <gagh>")

     <Gagh,> the Klingon delicacy consisting of serpent
worms in a sauce, is ideally eaten while the worms are
still alive. To kill <gagh> ({qagh HoH}), therefore, is counter-
productive, to say the least, and that is the notion this
idiom conveys. The phrase is applied to a person and
means that he or she is doing something counterproduc-
tive: {SuyDuj DaQaw'chugh qagh DaHoH} ("If you de-
stroy the merchant ship, you kill <gagh>"; {SuyDuj,}
"merchant ship"; {DaQaw'chugh,} "if you destroy it")---
that is, destroying the merchant ship is contrary to the
best interests of the current mission.

     {latlh HIvje'Daq 'Iw HIq bIr yIqang!} ("Pour the
          cold bloodwine into another glass!")

     This means something along the lines of "I don't
believe you; maybe someone else will" or "That is irrele-
vant to me; maybe someone else will care." The circum-
stances that prompted the first usage of this saying are
unknown, but the imagery is pretty straightforward,
especially with the understanding that bloodwine
should never be served cold. The expression is always
used in this imperative form ({latlh,} "other one";
{HIvje'Daq,} "into a drinking vessel"; {'Iw HIq,} "blood-
wine"; {bIr,} "be cold"; {yIqang,} "Pour it!"). A sentence
such as {latlh HIvje'Daq 'Iw HIq bIr vIqang} ("I pour
the cold bloodwine into another glass") would be inter-
preted only literally, though perhaps also as a statement
about the poor quality of the beverage.

     {may' bom pIm bom} ("sing a different battle
          song")

     This expression means "speak of another matter en-
tirely." It is used when someone changes the topic or of-
fers clarification on an existing one or when some new
information comes to light. When uttered, it is frequently [[p.119]]
preceded by {DaH} ("now") or {toH} ("Aha!"). For example,
if a Klingon warrior who has chosen to ignore a messen-
ger bearing what he thinks will be an irrelevant commu-
niquÃ© finds out that the message is from the leader of the
High Council himself, the warrior may say {DaH may'
bom pIm Dabom} ("Now you sing a different battle
song"; {may' bom,} "battle song"; {pIm,} "be different";
{Dabom,} "You sing it")---that is, "Well, that's another mat-
ter altogether." The idiomatic meaning comes across re-
gardless of who is said to be "singing" ({may' bom pIm
wIbom,} "We sing a different battle song"; {may' bom pIm
lubom,} "They sing a different battle song," etc.).

     {to'waQ yIv} ("chew ligament")

     This is an idiomatic way of saying "take some time to
consider a matter." The origins of the phrase are un-
known, but the imagery makes sense, since even with
Klingon teeth, to chew ({yIv}) gummy ligament or tendon
({to'waQ}) takes longer than to chew most other types of
food. The expression may be used as a command, as in
{to'waQ yIyIv!} ("Chew ligament!"---that is, "Take your
time thinking about it!") or as a statement, often with
the verb suffix {-taH} ("continuous"), implying an ongoing
activity, as in {to'waQ vIyIvtaH} ("I'm chewing liga-
ment"---that is, "I'm in the process of taking my time con-
sidering the matter"). Though not necessarily derogatory,
it is frequently used with negative connotations: {to'waQ
yIyIvQo'; DaH yIwuq!} ("Don't chew ligament; decide
now!"; {yIyIvQo',} "Don't chew!"; {DaH,} "now"; {yIwuq,}
"Decide!") or {HoD QaQbe' ghaH; reH to'waQ yIv} ("He/
she is not a good captain; he/she always chews ligament";
{HoD,} "captain"; {QaQbe'} "not be good"; {ghaH,} "he, she"; [[QaQbe':=QaQbe',]]
{reH,} "always").

     {maj ram} ("good, [it is] night")

     When going to sleep, Klingons generally have noth-
ing in particular to express to one another. There are a [[p.120]]
few set phrases, however, that parents frequently say to
their children, and the same expressions are commonly
used by good friends, particularly on a night before a bat-
tle. One of these phrases is {yInajchu'} ("dream well"; liter-
ally, a command: "Dream perfectly!"). The other, {maj
ram}, is an idiomatic expression usually rendered in Fed-
eration Standard as "good night," though this translation
obscures the real meaning of the sentiment. The Klingon
word {maj} is an exclamation expressing satisfaction, gen-
erally translated as simply "good," and functioning as a
sentence in its own right. The second word, {ram}, is a
noun meaning "night," and it is all that remains of two
formerly used longer expressions, {ngaj ram} ("The night
is short"; {ngaj,} "be short in duration") and {nI' ram} "The [["The:=("The]]
night is long"; {nI',} "be long in duration"). The original
full expressions, then, were {maj, ngaj ram} ("Good, the
night is short"), suggesting that it would not be long be-
fore the next day's activities could begin, or {maj, nI' ram}
("Good, the night is long"), suggesting that there was
ample opportunity for rejuvenation and meaningful
dreaming. Over time, as result of frequent repetition of
the phrases, the original intent of both versions was lost.
People said them but did not give much thought to what
they meant. They came to be used interchangeably, as if
they meant the same thing, namely "Good, it is night."
Later, the expressions were shortened by dropping the
superfluous (and, by then, meaningless) {ngaj} and {nI'},
leaving the contemporary {maj ram}. As a practical mat-
ter, Klingons still do not think about what {maj ram}
means; they just say it, if they say anything at all, upon
retiring.

     {bIQ ngaS HIvje'.} ("The cup contains water.")

     This idiomatic expression means "be quite mistaken,
be totally wrong." It has its origins in the disdain Klin-
gons generally have for water as a beverage. For a Klin-
gon, drinking anything is better than drinking water. [[p.121]]
Thus, it is always undesirable for one's glass or cup
({HIvje'}) to contain ({ngaS}) water ({bIQ}), and, by exten-
sion, it is inappropriate as well. When the phrase is used,
the person who is being characterized as mistaken is the
one whose cup it is: {bIQ ngaS HIvje'lIj} ("Your cup
contains water"---that is, "You're all wrong.") This is a
reasonably strong expression, and it would not be unex-
pected for a rather substantial fight to break out shortly
after the phrase is uttered.

     {wa'maH cha' pemmey wa'maH cha' rammey
          je} ("twelve days and twelve nights")

     This is a rather long-winded way to say "a long time"
(which would be {poH nI'} in nonidiomatic speech). It im-
plies a bit more than that, however, for it is used to mean
not only that the length of an event is long but also that
the event is an important one, worthy of taking up so
much time. The expression comes from the well-known
story of Kahless the Unforgettable, the founder of the
Klingon Empire, and his brother, Morath, who fought
for the fabled "twelve days and twelve nights" because
Morath had broken his word and brought shame to the
family. The word used for "days," {pemmey}, is the plural
form of {pem} ("day, daytime"), a word referring to the
part of the day when it is light out (as opposed to {ram}
["night"]). Another word, {jaj} ("day") refers to the full pe-
riod from dawn to dawn.

     {bIQ'a'Daq 'oHtaH 'etlh'e'.} ("The sword is in the
          ocean.")

     This is another expression based on a story about
Kahless. After Kahless's brother, Morath, killed their fa-
ther, Morath threw their father's sword into the ocean,
saying that if he could not have the sword, no one could.
After that, the brothers never spoke again. The idiom
{bIQ'a'Daq 'oHtaH 'etlh'e'} ("The sword is in the ocean";
{bIQ'a',} "ocean"; {'etlh,} "sword") is used to mean that [[p.122]]
something has ended, that it is impossible to return to a
prior condition, just as Kahless and Morath never spoke
to each other again. The expression might be used, for
example, in reference to a treaty that was just signed,
suggesting that a former state of antagonism has ended
forever. Of course, simply saying that something will last
forever does not make it so. If an alliance ends, the
phrase is equally apt: the era of peace has ended, and the
sword is in the ocean---there is no going back.

     {ghaH vuv SuS neH} ("want the wind to respect
          [someone]")

     A well-known Klingon myth tells of a man in the an-
cient city of Quin'lat who dies because, during a storm,
he remained outside the walls of the city in order to show
that he was not afraid of the storm and to make the storm
respect him. Kahless, who was in the city at the time,
remarked {qoH vuvbe' SuS} ("The wind does not respect
a fool"), which has become a frequently repeated prov-
erb. The idiomatic expression {ghaH vuv SuS neH} ("he/
she wants the wind to respect him/her"; {ghaH,} "him/her";
{vuv,} "respect"; {SuS,} "wind"; {neH,} "he/she wants") comes
from the same story; it is used to mean "He/she is foolish"
or "He/she is a fool." For example, one might answer the
question {qatlh betleHDaj tlhapbe'?} ("Why doesn't he
take his <bat'leth?">; {qatlh,} "why?"; {betleHDaj,} "his/her
<bat'leth">; {tlhapbe',} "He/she does not bring it") by saying
{ghaH vuv SuS neH} ("He wants the wind to respect
him"---that is, "He's a fool." The expression can be modi- [[.":=").]]
fied to apply to different persons or situations: {muvuvpu'
SuS vIneH} ("I wanted the wind to respect me"---in other
words, "I acted like a fool"); {bImaw''a'? Duvuv SuS Da-
neH'a'?} ("Are you crazy? Do you want the wind to re-
spect you?"---that is, "What's with you? Are you an
idiot?"). [[p.123]]

     {Ha'quj nge'} ("take away a sash")

     This is the Klingon equivalent of "wound one's
pride." The sash represents a Klingon's heritage. If the
sash is removed, so is the Klingon's ancestral identity,
and, along with it, his or her dignity and self-esteem. It is
generally used with a possessive pronominal suffix
attached to {Ha'quj} ("sash"): {Ha'qujwIj} ("my sash"), {Ha'-
qujlIj} ("your sash"), and so forth. Thus, the phrase {Ha'-
qujlIj nge'} (literally, "take away your sash") means
"wound your pride."

     {Doq bIQtIq bIQ.} ("The river water is red.")
     {Doq bIQtIq.} ("The river is red.")

     This expression, heard in both variants, means that
something momentous has happened, perhaps a major
victory. One might say {romuluS yo' wIjeyta'} ("We've de-
feated the Romulan fleet"; {yo',} "fleet"; {wIjeyta',} "We have
succeeded in defeating it") and then add, to point out the
significance of the occasion, {Doq bIQtIq bIQ} ("The river
water is red"; {Doq,} "be red"; {bIQtIq,} "river"; {bIQ,}
"water"). The phrase can be traced back to an old drink-
ing song that commemorates the slaying of the tyrant
Molor by Kahless. On that day, according to the song, the
River Skral ran red; that is, it was filled with the blood of
Molor. As noted earlier (see the chapter on Argot: Spe-
cialized Vocabulary, under "Visual Arts," pages 78--83), [[>>link]]
the Klingon word {Doq} ("be red"), which occurs in the
song as well as in the idiom, really means much more
than "red." It refers to a rather wide spectrum of colors
ranging from deep red to bright orange and includes
pink. Nearly all Klingon bodily fluids, including blood,
can be described as {Doq}.

     {cha' qabDu'} ("two faces")
     {qabDu' law'} ("many faces") [[p.124]]

     The first of these similar phrases means that two in-
dividuals are involved in some activity and no one else is.
Common Federation Standard equivalents are "face-to- [[keep hyphen]]
face" (which is based on the same imagery) and "one-on- [[keep hyphen]]
one." Grammatically, it usually functions as the subject
of a sentence, such as {Suv cha' qabDu'} ("Two faces
fight"---that is, "They are fighting one-on-one"; {Suv,}
"fight"; {cha',} "two"; {qabDu',} "faces"). The similar idiom
{qabDu' law'} ("many faces"; {law',} "be many") may be
used to refer to a group participating in a single activity.
Thus, a brawl may be described by saying {Suv qabDu'
law'} ("Many faces fight").

     {quSDaq ba'} ("sit in a chair")

     Probably influenced by the homophony of verb suf-
fix {-ba'} ("obviously") and the verb {ba'} ("sit"), this ex-
pression has come to mean "that's obvious." It is used
only in a condescending manner as a response to some-
thing that the hearer deems so self-evident that it need
not have been stated in the first place. For example,
upon hearing an obvious remark, one might say, {quS-
Daq bIba'} ("You sit in a chair"---that is, "What you said
is quite obvious") or {quSDaq ba'} ("He/she sits in a
chair"---that is, "What he/she said is quite obvious";
{quSDaq,} "in a chair").

     {pel'aQDaj ghorpa'} ("before it breaks its shell")

     This idiom means something like "before it's too late"
or "while there's still time." The literal meaning of the
phrase evokes the image of an egg with a baby animal
inside who will, at some point, break ({ghor}) the shell
({pel'aQ}), get out, and presumably pose some kind of
threat, or at least inconvenience. One might use the ex-
pression in a sentence such as {pel'aQDaj ghorpa' qama'
yIHoH} ("Before it breaks its shell, kill the prisoner"---
that is, "Kill the prisoner now, while you've got a chance";
{qama',} "prisoner"; {yIHoH,} "Kill him/her!"). [[p.125]]

     {bo'Dagh'a' lo'} ("use a big scoop")
     {bo'DaghHom lo'} ("use a little scoop")

     The phrase {bo'Dagh'a' lo'} is another way to say "ex-
aggerate," though it has negative connotations of exag-
gerating when it is inappropriate to do so. If a warrior,
for example, boasts about his recent exploits in a way
other warriors find unbelievable, someone might say {bo'-
Dagh'a' lo'} ("He's using a big scoop"---that is, "He's exag-
gerating"). It is not uncommon to confront someone by
making use of this phrase (for example, {qaHarbe'; bo'-
Dagh'a' Dalo'} ["I don't believe you; you're using a big
scoop"---that is, "You're exaggerating"]) or to use it to as-
sert one's veracity, as in {bo'Dagh'a' vIlo'be'} ("I am not
using a big scoop"---in other words, "I am not exaggerat-
ing"). The "scoop" ({bo'Dagh}) in the phrase is the imple-
ment used to remove food from the pot in which it was
prepared and place it on a serving platter. This is hardly
a delicate operation, so scooping with a {bo'Dagh} entails
transferring as much food as possible on each trip from
pot to platter. Using a "big scoop" ({bo'Dagh'a'}) would
imply transferring even greater quantities of food, per-
haps more than the serving plate can handle. An altered
form of this expression substitutes {bo'DaghHom} ("little
scoop") for {bo'Dagh'a'} ("big scoop"). The phrase {bo'-
DaghHom lo'} ("use a little scoop") means "make less of
something than it really is" or "minimize the importance
of something," again with the connotation that this is in-
appropriate.

     {mIvDaq pogh cha'} ("display a glove on [one's]
          helmet")

     This idiom is used to convey the idea that a matter
has been postponed or rescheduled. It has nothing what-
soever to do with a helmet ({mIv}) or a glove ({pogh}), but it
came about because of an incident in literature that did
deal with these articles of clothing. In Shakespeare's [[p.126]]
original Klingon version of {HenrI' vagh}, known in Feder-
ation Standard as <Henry V>, HenrI', the Supreme Com- [[HenrI':={HenrI'}]]
mander, gets into an argument with one of his troops the
night before a great battle. Knowing that they are needed
for combat the next day, and not wishing to jeopardize
what they both know will be a most glorious battle, they
agree to put off their fight until a better time. Each gives
the other a glove as a reminder, and they put the gloves
in their helmets. Thus, a glove on one's helmet has come
to stand for an acknowledgment that a matter is pending,
but that there is a more important matter that must be
attended to first. It is a statement about both honoring
one's obligations and setting priorities, both Klingon vir-
tues. The phrase can be heard in a number of forms, de-
pending on the parties to the commitment. For example,
{mIvwIjDaq poghlIj vIcha'} ("I display your glove on my
helmet"; {mIvwIjDaq,} "on my helmet," {poghlIj,} "your [[,":=";]]
glove," {vIcha',} "I display it") implies that the postponed [[,":=";]]
matter is between the speaker and the addressee.

     {jej pach.} ("The claw is sharp.")
     {jejHa' pach.} ("The claw is dull.")

     As discussed earlier (see the chapter on Argot: Spe-
cialized Vocabulary, under "Food," page 85), these two [[>>link]]
idioms refer to the taste of food. To say {jej pach} ("The
claw is sharp") is to say that the food is pungent---that is,
good. If the food is bland, one may say {jejHa' pach} ("The
claw is dull").

     {cha'maH cha' joQDu'} ("twenty-two ribs")

     Klingons have 23 ribs ({joQDu'}). The idiom {cha'maH
cha' joQDu'} ("twenty-two ribs"; {cha'maH cha',} "twenty- [[keep hyphen]]
two"), leaving one rib out, is used to indicate that some-
thing is missing or not quite right, especially when it is
difficult or impossible to explain the problem. It can be
used in varied circumstances. For example, referring to a
situation, one might say {naDev cha'maH cha' joQDu' [[p.127]]
tu'lu'} ("There are twenty-two ribs here"; {naDev,} "here";
{tu'lu',} "there is/are")---that is, there is something out of
the ordinary going on, even if no one can say exactly
what. Referring to a person, one could say {cha'maH cha'
joQDu' ghaj qama'} ("The prisoner has twenty-two ribs";
{ghaj,} "have"; {qama',} "prisoner"), suggesting that the
prisoner is somehow a bit strange. If any other number
is used, such as {cha'maH wa' joQDu'} ("twenty-one
ribs"), the phrase is always interpreted literally---that is,
as a statement about anatomy. If, by chance, a Klingon
really does have only 22 ribs, owing to a prior injury, for
example, reference to this fact is usually phrased in a way
to avoid saying {cha'maH cha' joQDu'} ("twenty-two
ribs") and having to deal with the snickers. A common
alternative is {wa' joQ Hutlh ghaH} ("He/she lacks one
rib").


SIMILES

     There are a number of common Klingon expres-
sions similar to such Federation Standard phrases as
"stubborn as a mule" or "busy as a bee." In Klingon,
however, such similes, as such rhetorical devices are
known, are constructed as if two sentences. The first
attributes a quality to someone or something; the sec-
ond makes use of the verb {rur} ("resemble") to link the
quality to something that presumably epitomizes the
quality. For example, "trivial as a glob fly" would be
{ram; ghIlab ghew rur} ("He/she/it is trivial; he/she/it
resembles a glob fly"; {ram,} "be trivial, insignificant";
{ghIlab ghew,} "glob fly").
     Some Klingons are rather creative in their use of this
construction, making up a new simile on the spot for a
given occasion, sometimes coming up with rather poetic
images, such as {let mInDu'Daj; Separmey rur} ("Her
eyes are hard; they resemble <separ> [a type of gemstone]";
{let,} "be hard"; {mInDu'Daj,} "his/her eyes"; {Separmey,} [[p.128]]
{{

[[image]]

Valkris (Cathie Shirriff)---her heart was as hard as her eyes. [[x!]]

}} [[p.129]]
"<separs>"). This facility is an admirable one, demonstra-
ting the speaker's wit and mastery of the language. In-
deed, several drinking games are built around devising
ever more inventive phrases with {rur}. There are, in addi-
tion, a number of set phrases that are used repeatedly
and are known by everyone. Most of these have been
heard so often that they have become overused---that is,
they are clichÃ©s. Employing a smattering of clichÃ©s in
one's speech is both natural and acceptable, but using
too many makes one's speech less effective and is not at
all desirable. To be on the safe side, a visitor should be
familiar with the clichÃ©s in order to understand what is
being said, but at the same time he or she should remem-
ber to actually use them only once in a while.
     Some of these comparisons can be understood only
if one if familiar with various aspects of Klingon culture, [[if one if:=if one is]]
such as mythology, history, proverbs, cuisine, weaponry,
and so on. For example, for a Klingon, a hammer is a
symbol of power. The phrase {HoSghaj; mupwI' rur}
("powerful as a hammer") is based on this notion. (Here,
and in the discussion that follows, translations of the
similes with {rur} are given in the familiar Federation
Standard form, as in "powerful as a hammer," though a
literal translation would be more like "He/she/it is power-
ful; he/she/it resembles a hammer.") The following simi-
les also find their origins in Klingon culture:

     {bIr; bortaS rur} ("cold as revenge")
     {puj; bIQ rur} ("weak as water")
     {HoS; 'Iw rur} ("strong as blood")
     {'oj; bomwI' rur} ("thirsty as a singer")

     The likening of "cold" to "revenge" comes from the
old Klingon proverb "Revenge is a dish which is best
served cold." Water, to Klingons, has long been a symbol
of weakness or lack of control, especially when it is con-
trasted with blood, a symbol of strength. The association
of thirst with singing is probably due to the custom of [[p.130]]
accompanying drinking with singing and the usual prac-
tice of continuing both of these activities for a great
length of time.

     {ghung; qagh rur} ("hungry as <gagh>")
     {jeD; ghevI' rur} ("thick as <gagh> sauce")

     The serpent worms known as <gagh> are considered to
epitomize hunger because, in preparing them to be
eaten, they are virtually starved so that, at the last min-
ute, they will ravenously eat the delicious but toxic (to
them) sauce into which they are placed. This sauce
({ghevI'}), in turn, symbolizes thickness, although, in
truth, there are sauces that are thicker.

     {mIgh; molor rur} ("evil as Molor")
     {ngo'; QI'tu' rur} ("old as Qui'Tu")
     {qej; veqlargh rur} ("mean as Fek'lhr")
     {quvHa'; ghe'tor ngan rur} ("dishonored as an [[?? should {ghe'torngan} be one word?]]
          inhabitant of Gre'thor")
     {wov; ghI'boj Sech rur} ("bright as the Torch of
          G'boj")

     These expressions are based on Klingon history and
mythology. Molor was the tyrannical and hated ruler of
the Homeworld until he was killed by Kahless, who in
turn established the Klingon Empire. {QI'tu'}, sometimes
translated "Paradise," is the mythological source of all
creation, hence its association with antiquity. The word
{ngo'} in the phrase above means "old" as opposed to
"new." Thus, it would be applied to objects or ideas, but
not to animals or people. To say that a person is ex-
tremely old, the phrase would be {qan; QI'tu'} ("He/she is [[QI'tu':=QI'tu' rur]]
as old as <Qui'Tu>"). Fek'lhr is a somewhat ferocious myth- [[<Qui'Tu>:=Qui'Tu]]
ological beast that guards the entrance to Gre'thor, the
place where the spirits of the dishonored go. Finally, the
Torch of G'boj is one of the most revered historical ob-
jects in the Empire, though exactly why is seldom re-
vealed to outsiders. [[p.131]]

     {jej; Daqtagh rur} ("sharp as a <d'k tahg>")
     {lo'laHbe'; chetvI' chIm rur} ("worthless as an
          empty torpedo tube")
     {yuD; jey'naS rur} ("dishonest as a double-headed
          ax")

     These similes make reference to Klingon weapons.
The {Daqtagh} (<d'k tagh>) is the quintessential warrior's [[d'k tagh:=d'k tahg]]
knife. It would approach irreverence to think of one in
any condition other than sharp and ready for combat.
Significantly, the usual phrase used to describe the oppo-
site condition---that is, "dull, blunt"---makes reference
not to a weapon but to a tool: {jejHa'; naH taj rur} ("dull
as vegetable knife"). A {naH taj} ("vegetable knife" or "fruit [[as:=as a]]
knife") is hardly a dull instrument, but it does not come
close to the sharpness of a <d'k tagh>. The word {chetvI'} [[tagh:=tahg]]
("torpedo tube") in the second expression is also the
name of a hooked stick used in throwing certain type of [[certain:=a certain]]
spear, the {tlhevjaQ}. In the set phrase, however, it refers
only to a torpedo tube, not the stick, which suggests that
the phrase came into use only after the introduction of
torpedoes. While the {chetvI'} stick is certainly most use-
ful when used to hurl a spear, it cannot be said that it is
worthless otherwise. For example, if necessary, it can
serve as a weapon in its own right, as if a long cudgel. An
empty torpedo tube, on the other hand, is a most ineffec-
tive weapon. The connection of dishonesty to the {jey'naS}
ax is symbolic rather than literal: the two heads of the ax,
facing in different directions, represent duplicity. Be-
cause the double-headed ax is connected with dishon-
esty, the opposite quality--that is, honesty---is commonly
associated with a single-headed ax: {yuDHa'; ghIt rur}
("honest as an ax head"). The word {ghIt} ("ax head, ax
blade") also means "open, flat hand," and this fits into the
imagery as well. An honest person will have his or her
hands open, with nothing to hide. Thus, "honest as an
open hand" is an equally good rendition. [[p.132]]
     In a second type of simile, the quality is associated
with animals that stereotypically behave in a manner
consistent with or otherwise exhibiting a particular qual-
ity. For example:

     {Dogh; tIghla' rur} ("foolish as a <t'gla>")
     {tlhIb; toppa' rur} ("incompetent as a <topah>")
     {tIb; tI'qa' vIghro' rur} ("nervous as a <tika> cat") [[tIb:=bIt]]
     {tun; reghuluS 'Iwghargh rur} ("soft as a Regulan
          bloodworm")
     {naS; norgh rur} ("vicious as a <norg>")

     Perhaps this list should also contain {tlhab; ngem
Ha'DIbaH} "free [or independent] as a forest animal"), [["free:=("free]]
though this refers to how or where any animal lives
rather than to a specific animal. There is one more
exceedingly common expression that falls into this ani-
mal category, not so much because of the inherent
characteristics of the creature, but rather because of
Klingons' normal reaction to it: {'up; yIH rur} ("disgust-
ing as a tribble").
     Another set of similes link humanoid species of vari-
ous kinds to certain qualities:

     {matlhHa'; romuluSngan rur} ("disloyal as a
          Romulan")
     {qur; verengan rur} ("greedy as a Ferengi")
     {wIH; Hur'Iqngan rur} ("ruthless as a Hur'q")
     {Hoj; tera'ngan rur} ("cautious as a Terran")
     {Hem; tlhIngan rur} ("proud as a Klingon")

     One simile of this type associates a people with a
quality opposite from one they actually typify: {nong; vul-
qangan rur} ("passionate as a Vulcan.") This would be
used to describe somebody who was not passionate. As
far as can be determined, this is the only use of irony
in expressions of this type, and what led to this unique
occurrence is not known.
     Finally, there are some common similes whose [[p.133]]
meanings are obvious, such as {tam; Hew rur} ("quiet as
a statue"), while still others suggest no explanation what-
soever:

     {val; Huy' rur} ("clever as an eyebrow")
     {lugh; Sor rur} ("correct as a tree")
     {'IQ; rav rur} ("sad as a floor")
     {Sagh; Ho''oy'} ("serious as a toothache") [[Ho''oy':=Ho''oy' rur]]
     {boch; ghIch rur} ("shiny as a nose") [[p.134]]

LANGUAGE CHANGE AND
STAYING CURRENT

Klingon society is one in which tradition plays a
highly significant role. Ancient customs, rituals,
and beliefs are painstakingly, conscientiously, and suc-
cessfully passed on from one generation to the next. Klin-
gons revere their ancestors, respect their elders, and have
unparalleled veneration for heritage. Nevertheless, over
time, change does occur in all aspects of Klingon life,
and there are observable differences---some subtle, some
rather obvious---between the older and younger genera-
tions. The more established members of Klingon society
(generally speaking, older Klingons) tend to see change
as indicating the gradual downfall of the society, the loss
of values and traditions. "The warrior ethic is deteriorat-
ing" is a common lament. Younger Klingons, while ac-
cepting their heritage and observing the ancient rites, see
some aspects of their elders' behavior and beliefs as, if
not obsolete, then just old-fashioned. This state of affairs
was not brought on by recent technological innovation
such as galactic travel; it has been this way for centuries.
     The differences between younger and older Klingons
are mirrored in the way members of the different genera-
tions speak. While everyone does speak the same lan-
guage (and this discussion is restricted to {ta' Hol}, the
standard dialect), there are still certain speech patterns
clearly associated with younger speakers, and other pat- [[p.136]]
terns with older. Paralleling the differing attitudes about
other aspects of society, the Klingon spoken by older
members of society is considered by some to be "proper
and eloquent" and by others to be "stilted and confining";
the Klingon spoken by the younger generation is either
"sloppy and ungrammatical" or "innovative and expres-
sive." Though it is safe to say that much of this innova-
tion is heard among younger speakers, there is no clear
line of demarkation separating the generations, no age at
which one crosses over from "younger" to "older." Atti-
tude and stake in the status quo play greater roles than
does chronological age. Indeed, there is a great deal of
disagreement as to which newer features of the language
(generally, those associated with younger Klingons) are
acceptable innovations and which are simply errors. It is
therefore probably best for the visitor to avoid taking a
stand on what is "correct" Klingon and, when asked to
settle a dispute, to defer to the wisdom of the native
speakers, all of whom enjoy a good fight anyway.
     Depending upon one's age (or, more importantly,
upon the age group with which one most identifies), one
may or may not want to adopt the pronunciation pat-
terns or grammatical peculiarities associated with the
younger generation. It is worthwhile for a visitor to be
familiar with these patterns, however, if for no other rea-
son than to be able to understand what a younger Klin-
gon is saying.
     When it comes to vocabulary, on the other hand,
knowledge of prevailing terminology is essential if one
is to understand and participate in everyday conversa-
tion. There are words and expressions, usually dubbed
<slang>, that are infrequently used in scholarly or scien-
tific writing or in formal presentations, such as judicial
proceedings or governmental ceremonies, but they are
quite common otherwise, both in conversation and in
popular writing, such as romance novels. Such words
are often not included in textbooks or in classroom [[p.137]]
{{

}}[[p.138]]
instruction because they are not considered "proper."
Proper or not, to communicate successfully with Klin-
gons and to be comfortably accepted into their com-
pany, one must be aware of, understand, and use at
least some slang. To speak in a manner totally deficient
in the more colloquial forms of Klingon speech is to
betray one's status as an outsider.


GENERATIONAL DIFFERENCES:
PRONUNCIATION AND GRAMMAR

     The differences in pronunciation between younger
and older Klingons are rather subtle. As a result, the
characteristic patterns of younger people's speech, if no-
ticed and commented upon, are more likely to be judged
"sloppy" or "careless" rather than "wrong." First of all,
some younger speakers tend to pronounce doubled con-
sonants as if they were single, while older speakers pretty
much maintain the distinction between single and dou-
bled consonants. For example, in the word {qettaH} ("He/
she keeps on running"; {qet,} "run, jog," plus {-taH,} "contin-
uous"), an older Klingon would either pronounce each {t}
distinctly, releasing the first one with a puff of air before
articulating the second, or else he or she would hold the
{t} just a bit before releasing it, so that the time taken up
would be about the same as if each {t} were articulated
separately. A younger speaker, on the other hand, may
pronounce the word as if it were {qetaH}, though with the
stress remaining on the first syllable as it is in {qettaH}.
Similarly, an older speaker would probably maintain the
{mm} in {bommey} ("songs"; {bom,} "song," plus {-mey,} plural
indicator) by either pronouncing each {m} distinctly or,
more likely in this case, prolonging the {m}; some younger
speakers (though a smaller number than in the case of
{tt}) might say {bomey}, again with stress remaining on the
first syllable. Only in the case of {''} (as in {pa''a'} ["big
room"]: {pa',} "room," plus {-'a',} an augmentative) is there [[p.139]]
a tendency in both groups to reduce the {''} to a single {'},
though {''} (a somewhat prolonged gap between the pre-
ceding and following {a}) is hardly unknown or archaic- [[keep hyphen]]
sounding. The reduction of doubled consonants to single
follows a clear pattern. Those most likely to be reduced
are {pp}, {tt}, , and, as noted above, {''}; least likely to be re- [[, ,:=, {qq},]]
duced are {ll}, {mm}, {nn}, {ngng}, {vv}, {ww}, and {yy}.
     Younger speakers also have a slight tendency to
change the pronunciation of the vowel {a} in nonstressed
syllables to something that sounds a bit like the <u> in Fed-
eration Standard <but>. If this sound is transcribed with
the symbol {U}, a word like {qaleghpu'} ("I have seen you")
might sound more like {qUleghpu'}. This particular pho-
nological inclination seems particularly bothersome to
older Klingons and is generally considered an error wor-
thy of correction. Students who speak this way are cus-
tomarily reprimanded.
     When it comes to grammar, the younger generation
is innovative as well. One of the more noteworthy charac-
teristics of their speech is the placement of conjunctions
joining nouns ({je,} "and"; {joq,} "and/or"; {ghap,} "either/or").
In standard Klingon grammar, the conjunction follows
the last noun of the conjoined set; for example, {naQjej
'etlh taj je} ("spear, sword, and knife"; literally, "spear,
sword, knife and") or {tlhInganpu' romuluSnganpu'
ghap} ("either Klingons or Romulans"; that is, "Klingons
Romulans or"). Instead of putting the conjunction after
the last noun of the phrase, younger Klingons are often
heard putting it before the final noun: {naQjej 'etlh je taj},
{tlhInganpu' ghap romuluSnganpu'}. This is a common
young person's error, and teachers seem to be constantly
correcting it, with reasonable success. It is interesting to
note that in earlier stages of the language (and the form
of language still used in many rituals and in some forms
of writing), at least under certain circumstances, the con-
junction did indeed precede the final noun, meaning it
was not always a mistake to use that phrasing. [[p.140]]
     Younger Klingons also tend to use the imperative
prefix {yI-} in circumstances judged inappropriate by older
Klingons. In standard Klingon, the prefix {yI-} is attached
to a verb to form a command given to one person if there
is either no object or a singular object, as in, for example,
{yIjatlh!} ("Speak!") or {jagh yIHIv!} "Attack the enemy!";
{jagh,} "enemy". Also, it is used to form a command given
to more than one person if the object is singular: {jagh
yIHIv} ("[all of you] attack the enemy!") When the object
is plural, however, the prefix {tI-} is used instead, whether
the command is given to one or more than one: {jaghpu'
tIHIv!} ("Attack the enemies!") Some younger Klingons
are apt to use {yI-} rather than {tI-} when the object is plural,
saying, for example, {jaghpu' yIHIv!} for "Attack the ene-
mies!" This construction is heard with increasing regu-
larity, though hardly a majority of the time. It leads to no
misunderstanding as long as the object noun ({jaghpu'}
["enemies"] in the examples above) is marked for plu-
ral---that is, as long as it has a plural suffix (here, {-pu'}) or
is a word that is inherently plural (such as {cha} ["torpe-
does"]). Since marking the plural is never required, how-
ever, {jagh} could mean "enemy" or "enemies." While in
standard Klingon there is no ambiguity in these kinds of
commands---{jagh tIHIv!} must mean "Attack the ene-
mies!" because {tI-} is used specifically for plural ob-
jects---in the younger generation's way of speaking, {jagh
yIHIv!} could be either "Attack the enemy!" or "Attack the
enemies!", since {yI-} is used with both singular and plural
objects and {jagh} could be either. On the other hand, this
ambiguous use of {yI-} makes it possible to be vague on
purpose. That is, in Klingon (and in Federation Standard
also, for that matter), there is no easy way to say "Attack
the enemy or enemies, however many there may be." The
younger Klingons' {jagh yIHIv}, however, means exactly
that. Despite this debatable advantage, and despite the
slow but ongoing spread of the practice among younger [[p.141]]
speakers, most Klingons still consider the ambiguous use
of {yI-} an error.
     One habit of younger speakers that seems to be tak-
ing hold among speakers in general involves planet
names. Though no official treaty or agreement exists,
Klingons generally follow a naming scheme used
throughout the galaxy whereby a planet's name is really
the name of its sun (or one of them) followed by a num-
ber referring to its orbit. Within a solar system, the
planet orbiting closest to the sun is numbered "one," the
next is "two," and so on. Thus {lIghon wa'} ("Ligon I") is
the planet orbiting closest to the Ligon sun; {lIghon cha'}
("Ligon II") is the second closest. There are a couple of
other ways planet names are derived. Sometimes the
Klingon name is simply a rendition of the name used by
the inhabitants of the planet, such as {tera'} ("Earth,
Terra"). On other occasions, a name is a Klingon version
of the name used not by the natives of a planet but by
another alien culture. Thus, {romuluS} ("Romulus") is
based on the Federation name of the planet; the actual
Romulan name is something quite distinct.
     A name for the inhabitant of a planet (and, therefore,
the name of a race of beings) is formed by adding {ngan}
("inhabitant") to the planet name (excluding the number,
if any): {lIghonngan} ("Ligonian"), {tera'ngan} ("Earther,
Terran"), {romuluSngan} ("Romulan"). (Actually, there is
some phonetic variation here. "Ligonian" is often pro-
nounced {lIghongan}, dropping the final {n} of {lIghon} be-
fore the initial {ng} of {ngan}. This is not considered an
error, only an alternate pronunciation.)
     Occasionally, and no doubt owing to influence from
Federation Standard, from which names, as noted, are
often taken, an extra syllable, {-ya'-,} comes between the [[?? should {-ya'}, {-ya'-} or {ya'} be used in this paragraph?]]
planet name and {ngan}. Thus, "Denebian"---that is, an in-
habitant of one of the Deneb planets---is both {DenIb-
ngan} and {DenIbya'ngan}. The planet name itself is also
heard in two forms: {DenIb} (formed from the name [[p.142]]
<Deneb>) and {DenIbya'} (formed by dropping the {ngan}
from {DenIbya'ngan}). The syllable {ya'} seems to be used
as if it were a suffix meaning "place name." Thus, Ligon
has sometimes been called {lIghonya'} in addition to
{lIghon}, Organia is both {'orghenya'} and {'orghen}, and
Cardassia is both {qarDaS} and {qarDaSya'}. The {-ya'} can-
not be added to all planet names, however. No one ever
says {romuluSya'} ("Romulus") or {tera'ya'} ("Earth") and
certainly not {Qo'noSya'} ("Kronos"), the Klingon Ho-
meworld itself.
     For a long time, the two forms of planet names were
used with roughly equal frequency, with the {-ya'} variants
having just a slight edge in formal and scholarly contexts,
and one might have considered {-ya'} to be simply a place- [[keep hyphen]]
name suffix. More recently, however, younger speakers
have been favoring the shorter forms (that is, those lack-
ing {-ya'}), and this habit seems to be slowly spreading to
older speakers as well. Though the longer names are cer-
tainly still heard and are unobjectionable, {-ya'} may, over
time, fall out of usage altogether.
     Which, if any, of the other speech patterns currently
associated primarily with younger speakers will become
acceptable among Klingons at large as time goes on can-
not be predicted with certainty. Some will probably wind
up as simply fads of the current era; others will be used
with increasing frequency and ultimately replace current
standards. For a visitor to a Klingon settlement, of
course, the fate of any given trait is only of academic in-
terest. What is important is to be aware of the differences
so that communication is not impeded.


VOCABULARY: SLANG

     Except in formal situations, the speech of younger
Klingons is apt to contain a fair amount of slang, or
{mu'mey ghoQ (}literally, "fresh words"). Though the term [[ (}:=} (]]
<slang> can be defined in a number of ways, here it is used [[p.143]]
to refer to words used in colloquial speech in the place of
or in addition to standard words. Choosing to express a
concept by means of slang rather than a standard word
or phrase is a way to show social identity. That is, using
a common set of special terms marks the users as mem-
bers of the same subgroup within the society. Such a sub-
group could be occupational (such as artists or warriors)
or geographic, but in the case of Klingon {mu'mey ghoQ},
the innovative vocabulary is used primarily, though
hardly exclusively, by the younger generation. As with
other aspects of the speech of the younger Klingons,
many older Klingons, particularly those most resistant to
any change in Klingon society, avoid using slang and de-
ride its use. There are some older Klingons, on the other
hand, who use slang quite comfortably, especially when
communicating with younger Klingons. The disagree-
ment about the status of slang is reflected in the terms
used for "standard" or "proper" Klingon words. As noted
earlier, those who tend to favor the use of slang often
call standard words {mu'mey Doy'} ("tired words"). Those
who dislike the use of slang, on the other hand, refer to
standard words as {mu'mey qar} ("accurate words").
     Anyone who participates in the Klingon-speaking
community is aware of slang, whether or not he or she
uses or understands specific words. A speaker's choice of
words associates him or her with a specific group. For
example, a younger Klingon who wants to appear more
grown-up may use relatively little slang, or a command-
ing officer may use quite a bit to show that he fits in with
his younger troops.
     An important characteristic of slang is that for the
most part, the nonstandard terms do not come about be-
cause a word or phrase is missing from the standard vo-
cabulary. Though slang expressions are often vivid or
imaginative alternatives to standard vocabulary, there
are almost always standard ways to express the same [[p.144]]
thing, though sometimes in phrases rather than individ-
ual words.
     Slang also tends to be transient. That is, a particular
expression may be in common use for a while---
sometimes for only a year or so---and then fall out of
fashion, to be replaced by a newer term or a return to the
standard expression. Using an antiquated term marks the
speaker as being out of step with Klingon society, a cause
for rejection by some other Klingons. Not all slang ex-
pressions have short lives, however. Some remain in use
for years, some become outmoded only to be in fashion
again some time later, and some, after a while, actually
become accepted as "proper." Sometimes, a slang expres-
sion shifts from one group within the society to another.
A word once used primarily by, say, members of the mili-
tary may be adopted by the younger generation in gen-
eral. What may be passÃ© in military circles may be au
courant among kids.
     In order to fit into Klingon society as much as possi-
ble, a visitor should be comfortable with a good deal of
slang, but because of its ever-changing nature, staying
current is a difficult task. Any available list of slang ex-
pressions will lack the newest terms and will also proba-
bly contain several expressions that have become old hat [[?? old hat]]
or associated with different groups. The best course of
action is probably to study and become familiar with the
expressions before traveling to a Klingon planet, but then
to avoid using any expressions that Klingons themselves
do not use. Using only standard Klingon will not brand a
speaker as old-fashioned or out of touch, only as some-
what more formal and traditional.
     The following is a listing of some of the current slang
expressions used pretty much throughout the Klingon
Empire; others have been noted in previous sections. It
must be remembered, however, that between the time
this list was compiled and the time it is being read, new
expressions have no doubt come into common use and [[p.145]]
some of the expressions on the list may have become ob-
solete. The origins of the expressions are indicated when
known.

     {bachHa'} ("err, make a mistake")

     This word literally means something like "mis- [[keep hyphen]]
shoot"---that is, "shoot wrongly." It is used in such con-
structions as {jIbachHa'pu'} ("I have made a mistake"; lit-
erally, "I have mis-shot"; {jI-,} "I"; {-pu',} perfective). The
standard word meaning "err, make a mistake" is {Qagh},
as in {jIQaghpu'} ("I have make a mistake"). [[make:=made]]

     {bej} ("be sure, definite, positive, certain")

     The verb {bej} literally means "watch," though its slang
usage is probably influenced by the verb suffix {-bej} ("cer-
tainly, undoubtedly"; compare {voq,} "trust," and {voqbej,}
"certainly trust"). It is used in such forms as {jIbej} ("I am
positive [about something I just said]"---literally, "I
watch" [{jI-,} "I"]) or {bIbej'a'?} ("Are you sure?"---literally,
"Do you watch?" [{bI-,} "you"; {-'a',} interrogative). Unlike [[):=])]]
the verb {na'} ("be salty"), which has an identical slang
meaning (see below), the verb {bej} may be used when [[below:=pp. 155, 157]] [[?? more complete *link*]]
there is an object: {HIvrup 'e' vIbej} ("I am positive they're
ready to attack"; literally, "I watch that they're ready to
attack"; {HIv,} "[they] attack"; {-rup,} "ready"; {'e',} "that";
{vI-,} "I [do something to] it"). The notions expressed by
{bej} can be conveyed without slang with a word such as
{Honbe'} ("not doubt") or by making use of the verb suf-
fix {-bej,} as in {HIvrupbej} ("They're certainly ready to at-
tack").

     {bochmoHwI'} ("sycophant, flatterer, one who
          tries to curry favor by flattering a superior")

     Literally "shiner, one who shines (something)," this
word is all that remains of an earlier expression, {'etlh
bochmoHwI'} ("blade shiner"). It was originally used to
refer to someone who shined somebody else's blade, as [[p.146]]
{{

[[image: source?]]

Garak (Andrew Robinson), a Cardassian operative in the mirror [[x!]]
universe who is a {bochmoHwI'}. <Robbie Robinson> [[x!]]

}} [[p.147]]
opposed to one's own, suggesting the idea of flattering a
superior rather than simply doing one's own work.
A nonslang equivalent might be {naDwI'} ("one who
praises"), though this lacks the overtones of "self- [[keep hyphen]]
serving."

     {bolwI'} ("traitor")

     This word actually means "drooler"---that is, "one
who drools" ({bol,} "drool"; {-wI',} "one who [does some-
thing]"). The nonslang word meaning "traitor" is
{maghwI'} (literally, "one who betrays" [{magh,} "betray"]).
Probably because of the parallel formation of {bolwI'} and
{maghwI'} (that is, verb plus {-wI'}), the verb {bol} ("drool")
is sometimes used to mean "betray," as if it were equiva-
lent to {magh}. In this usage, {bol}, like {magh}, may take an
object; that is, the sentence may indicate who is betrayed:
{mumaghpu'} ("He/she has betrayed me"; {mu-,} "He/she
[does something to] me"; {maghpu',} "has betrayed") or
{mubolpu'} ("He/she has betrayed me"; literally, "He/she
has drooled me"; {bolpu',} "has drooled"). In its nonslang
sense, {bol} does not take an object: {bolpu'} ("He/she has
drooled").

     {buy' ngop.} ("It is good to hear that.")

     This expression is often uttered when one has just
been given good news, such as a report of victory in a
battle. Literally, the phrase means "The plates are full"
({buy',} "be full, filled up"; {ngop}, "plates"), suggesting an
abundance of food. If the information is particularly
good, one may add the emphatic suffix {-qu'} to the verb:
{buy'qu' ngop} ("That's <really> good news"; literally, "The
plates are very full"). Similarly, if the information is con-
sidered only partially good, or only the forerunner of
good news to come, one might use the suffix {-law'} ("ap-
parently"): {buy'law' ngop} ("That seems to be good
news"; literally, "The plates are apparently full"). In stan-
dard Klingon, one might say {De'vetlh vIQoy, vaj jIQuch} [[p.148]]
("I am happy to hear that information"; {De'vetlh,} "that
information"; {vIQoy,} "I hear it"; {vaj,} "so, therefore"; {jI-
Quch,} "I am happy").

     {chatlh} "nonsense, balderdash" [["nonsense, balderdash":=("nonsense, balderdash")]]

     This word literally means "soup." It is not known why
{chatlh} took on this slang meaning. The standard word
for "nonsense" is {Dap}.

     {chelwI'} ("someone who deals in finances,
          accounting, etc.")

     Mildly derogatory in its slang usage, this word liter-
ally means "adder, one who adds." There is no known
nonslang counterpart, though {HuchQeD} (literally,
"money science") is often used for "economics."

     {chong} ("be profound, thorough, careful"; also
          "good, excellent")

     Literally "be vertical," this word is used to refer to
one's intellect, as in {chong tlhIngan SuvwI'} ("The Klin-
gon warrior is profound"---literally, "The Klingon warrior
is vertical"; {tlhIngan,} "Klingon"; {SuvwI',} "warrior"). In
its literal sense, this word is the opposite of {SaS} ("be ho-
rizontal"), and as a slang term, it is an opposite as well,
as {SaS} is used to mean "be shallow, superficial." It is
most likely that {chong} took on its slang meaning because
of the prior existence of {SaS}, which has been used as
slang for a much longer time. An equivalent meaning
may be expressed without slang by using a word such as
{Qubchu'} ("think perfectly, think clearly"; {Qub,} "think";
{-chu',} "perfectly, clearly"), as in {Qubchu' tlhIngan
SuvwI'} ("The Klingon warrior thinks clearly"). The word
{chong} may also be used as an exclamation expressing
approval or satisfaction, somewhat like standard {maj}
("good"). Thus, one may describe one's feelings about a
skillfully made knife or about an upcoming social event
by saying simply {chong} (literally, "vertical" but meaning [[p.149]]
"good, excellent, admirable"). See also {qu'} (literally, "be
fierce"), another slang term used to express approval.

     {chuH} ("explain clearly to, clarify for, specify for,
          spell out for")

     The literal meaning of {chuH} is "throw a spear at,
hurl a spear at." The object of {chuH} is usually the in-
tended target, the person or thing at which the spear is
thrown. In the slang sense, the object of the verb is the
person who wants clarification, as in {HIchuH!} ("Clarify
for me!" "Spell it out for me!"; literally, "Throw [a spear]
at me!") or {yaS chuH} ("He/she clarifies [it] for the offi-
cer"; literally, "He/she throws [a spear] at the officer").
The verb {QIj} ("explain") is a standard term somewhat
close to this in meaning, though the object of {QIj} is that
which is explained, while the person to whom the expla-
nation is given is the indirect object: {yaSvaD nab QIj}
("He/she explains the plan to the officer"; {yaSvaD,} "for
the officer"; {nab,} "plan").

     {Dach} ("not pay attention, be distracted, lack
          focus")

     The verb {Dach} literally means "be absent," but when
applied to a person who is obviously present or otherwise
accounted for, it is usually interpreted to mean that the
person's mind has wandered. It does not mean "absent-
minded," which involves forgetfulness. Rather, it means
that the person is, for whatever reason, not focusing on
the task at hand. Nonslang equivalents are {qImHa'} ("not
pay attention") and {buSHa',} ("not focus [on], ignore.")

     {Degh} ("take action without a plan, improvise")

     This expression may be based on {DeghwI'} ("helms-
man"). There is no known verb {Degh}, but if there were
such a word, presumably it would mean "steer," and {Degh-
wI'}, then, would be literally "one who steers," formed
from {Degh} plus the suffix {-wI'} ("one who does [some- [[p.150]]
thing]"). There is a related noun {Degh} ("helm"), but
since {-wI'} follows only verbs, there must have been a verb
{Degh} at one time that has fallen out of use, at least in the
sense of "steer." It is the absence of a verb {Degh} from the
standard vocabulary that makes this term slang and that
also allows it to have a specialized meaning: not "steer"
in the usual sense of guiding a vessel along a set course
or defined path but rather in the sense of maneuvering
without a plan, without a set course or path. In the stan-
dard vocabulary, there is no single word equivalent
meaning "improvise" or the like, but the idea can be ex-
pressed in a phrase such as {nab Hutlh 'ach vang} ("He/
she lacks a plan, but he/she takes action"; {nab,} "plan";
{Hutlh,} "He/she lacks it"; {'ach,} "but"; {vang,} "He/she takes
action").

     {Duj ngaDHa'} ("person who is wildly
          irresponsible, out of control, undisciplined")

     This expression means literally "unstable vessel, un-
balanced vessel." {Duj} is "vessel"; the verb {ngaD} ("be sta-
ble, balanced," here followed by the negative suffix {-Ha'})
normally applies to a ship or a physical object, not to a
situation or a person. It would be inappropriate to refer
to a person as {ngaD} or {ngaDHa'} in a phrase such as
{tera'ngan ngaDHa'} ("unstable Terran"). A standard verb
that is close in meaning is {ngIj} ("rowdy, unruly"), as in
{tera'ngan ngIj} ("rowdy Terran").

     {ghIgh} ("assignment, task, duty")

     As this word literally means "necklace," perhaps the
slang usage is based on the old practice of identifying
one's position within a military unit---for example, one's
assignment on a ship---by means of a symbol hung on a
chain worn around the neck. On the other hand, it may
be based on the idea that assignment to a specific task
holds one in that position as if by means of a line around [[p.151]]
the neck. The usual nonslang word for "assignment, mis-
sion" is {Qu'}.

     {Haq} ("intervene in [a situation]")

     The word {Haq} actually means "perform surgery on
(someone)." Even though Klingon doctors generally have
thriving practices and a doctor is always part of a ship's
crew, not only is being under a doctor's care considered
a sign of weakness, but it is also regarded as a relinquish-
ing of self-control. Klingons tend to avoid visiting doctors
except under the most serious of circumstances and, as a
result, doctors spend a great deal of their time tending
to critically wounded patients and relatively little time
performing routine examinations or practicing preven-
tive medicine. The general term for "doctor" or "physi-
cian" is {Qel}, but a "surgeon," a doctor who actually
manipulates the internal organs or bones of the patient
and thereby is the most invasive, is a {HaqwI'}, "one who
performs surgery." The slang term {Haq} developed from
the association of surgery with invasion of the person,
hence "intervene." Just as {Haq} in the nonslang sense of
"perform surgery" has negative connotation, the slang
term {Haq} ("intervene") is likewise disparaging, implying
that the intervention was unnecessary and/or that the
party doing the intervening somehow handled the situa-
tion badly. Thus, if one were to say {jagh HIvrup SuvwI'
Haqpa' DIvI' qeSwI'} ("The warrior was prepared to at-
tack the enemy until the Federation advisor inter-
vened"---literally, "The warrior was prepared to attack
the enemy before the Federation advisor performed sur-
gery"; {jagh,} "enemy"; {HIvrup,} "be prepared to attack";
{SuvwI',} "warrior"; {Haqpa',} "before he/she performed
surgery"; {DIvI',} "Federation"; {qeSwI',} "advisor"), the im-
plication is that the advice was unnecessary, counterpro-
ductive, or both. The common nonslang term for
"intervene" is {mun}. [[p.152]]

     {Ha'DIbaH} ("dog, cur, inferior person")

     {Ha'DIbaH} means "animal" in general (also "meat" of
any kind), but when applied to a person, it is an insult.
It is most frequently used epithetically---that is, in name
calling---as in {romuluS Ha'DIbaH!} ("Romulan dog!"; lit-
erally, "Romulan animal!").

     {Hom} ("weakling, runt, scrawny one, skinny one")

     This word literally means "bone," but its slang usage
is no doubt influenced by the noun suffix {-Hom,} a dimin-
utive that adds a meaning of smallness or lack of impor-
tance (compare {taj} ["knife"] and {tajHom} ["little knife,"
the extra small blade in the handle of a <d'k tahg> knife]).
There are a number of standard counterparts to {Hom,}
such as {pujwI'} ("weakling"), {langwI'} ("one who is thin"),
and {runwI'} ("one who is short").

     {Ho'} ("idol, someone worthy of emulation,
          something deserving of respect")

     This is actually the word for "tooth," but it is applied to
someone who is admired or revered. It might be used in a
phrase such as {Ho' SoH} ("You are an idol" or "You are
someone worthy of emulation"; literally, "You are a tooth"
[{SoH,} "you"]) or {Ho' ghaH HoD'e'} ("The captain is an
idol"; literally, "The captain is a tooth"; {ghaH,} "he/she";
{HoD,} "captain"; {-'e',} "topic"). Grammatically, even as slang,
{Ho'} follows the rules appropriate to its literal meaning.
Thus, even though it may refer to a person, its plural is
{Ho'Du'} ("teeth"), making use of the plural suffix for body
parts ({-Du'}), not {Ho'pu'}, with {-pu'}, the plural suffix for be-
ings capable of using language. Similarly, it never takes the
possessive suffixes associated with beings capable of using
language. That is, "my idol" (literally, "my tooth") is {Ho'wIj}
(with {-wIj}, the general suffix for "my"), not {Ho'wI'} (with
{-wI'}, the suffix for "my" used with beings capable of using
language). The slang meaning of {Ho'} is no doubt influ-
enced by the identically sounding verb {Ho'} ("admire"), and, [[p.153]]
indeed, the closest nonslang counterpart is probably a
phrase with this verb: {HoD Ho'lu'} ("The captain is ad-
mired"; {Ho'lu',} "someone admires").

     {Hur'Iq} ("outsider, foreigner")

     This word originally referred only to the people
known as the Hur'q, a race of humanoids from the
Gamma Quadrant who developed a reputation as ruth-
less invaders who would attack other societies primarily
for the purpose of robbery, stealing whatever they could
and destroying the rest. The Hur'q invaded the Klingon
homeworld some 1,000 years ago, and the loss to the
Klingons was so disastrous, not to mention humiliating,
that Klingon society became increasingly intolerant of
other races. In time, the Hur'q came to symbolize any
non-Klingon. Actually, in Klingon, a Hur'q person would
be {Hur'Iqngan}, while {Hur'Iq} refers to Hur'q society or
their homeland. This shorter word took on the slang
meaning of "outsider, foreigner." The standard term for
"foreigner, alien" is {nov}.

     {jav} ("prisoner")

     The origin of this slang usage of {jav} (literally, "six")
is unknown. The usual word for "prisoner" is {qama'}.

     {luH} "cause [someone] to confess, cause
          [someone] to reveal a secret")

     This verb literally means "yank" and is used in such
sentences as {jav luHpu' 'avwI'} ("The guard has caused a
prisoner to confess"---literally, "The guard has yanked a
six"; {jav,} "prisoner" [slang, see above]; {luHpu',} "has
yanked'; {'avwI',} "guard"). Standard words expressing the [[';:=";]]
same notions are {DISmoH} ("cause to confess") and
{peghHa'moH} ("cause to not keep a secret").

     {moH} ("exert undue influence on [somebody,
          something]") [[p.154]]

     The verb {moH} (literally, "be ugly") normally does not
take an object. In its slang meaning, however, it is used
only if there is an object, as if it were "(somebody) uglies
(somebody)." For example, it is found in such expres-
sions as {DamoH} ("You exert undue influence on him/
her"; literally, "You ugly him/her"; {Da-,} "You [do some-
thing to] him/her"). The word {bImoH}, with the prefix {bI-}
("you [no object]"), can mean only "You are ugly." The
slang usage of {moH} is probably influenced by the verb
suffix {-moH} ("cause"), as in {mevmoH} ("cause [someone]
to stop"---(compare {mev,} "[someone] stops"). In stan-
dard Klingon, the verb meaning "influence" is {SIgh}.

     {mo'} ("motive, motivation, grounds, reason,
           rationale")

     This word literally means "cage," suggesting that
one's reasons for accomplishing a particular act are
somehow restrictive or confining, as if preventing "es-
cape" into other forms of behavior. The slang meaning is
no doubt also influenced by the noun suffix {-mo'} ("due
to," as in {HeSmo',} "due to the crime") and verb suffix
{-mo'} ("because," as in {HIvmo'} ["because he/she at-
tacks"]). The slang term {mo'} is used in sentences such as
{jaghpu' mo' wIyajnIS} ("We must understand the ene-
mies' motive"; literally, "We must understand the ene-
mies' cage"; {jaghpu',} "enemies"; {wIyajnIS,} "We must
understand it"). A close standard equivalent is {meq} ("rea-
son")---that is, "logical thinking."

     {naQ} ("ponytail")

     The usual word for the popular hairstyle called a "po-
nytail" in Federation Standard is {DaQ}, but the word {naQ}
(literally, "cane, staff") is frequently heard instead. This
may have originated with the Krotmag dialect's pronun-
ciation of {DaQ}, which sounds like {naQ} to most Klingons
(see the chapter on The Fiction of Klingon Conformity,
under "Pronunciation," pages 18--23). Incidentally, a [[>>link]] [[p.155]]
slang expression for "ponytail holder," usually {choljaH},
is {Qeb}, the regular word for "ring" (for the finger).

     {natlh} ("be reprehensible, disgusting,
          contemptible, shameful, objectionable")

     The slang term {natlh} is a frequently heard expression
of disapproval or disgust, the speaker's comment on an
event, another person, or a situation. Though by no
means a curse and having no overtones of vulgarity, it is
nonetheless a rather forceful term, used to express a
strong emotion. Literally meaning "consume, use up, ex-
pend," {natlh} is normally applied to energy, fuel, supplies,
and the like and is used in phrases such as {nIn Hoch
natlhlu'pu'} ("All the fuel has been consumed"), with {nIn
Hoch} ("all the fuel"; {nIn,} "fuel"; {Hoch,} "all") functioning
as the object of the verb {natlhlu'pu'} ("someone/some-
thing has consumed it"). In its slang usage, however, the
verb never has an object and the subject is what is being
disparaged: {natlh 'Iw HIq} ("The bloodwine is disgust-
ing"; literally, "the bloodwine consumes"); {natlh romu-
luSnganpu'} ("Romulans are objectionable"; literally
"Romulans consume"); {bInatlh} ("You are contemptible";
literally, "You consume"). Often, the word is used with no
overt subject, as if an exclamation: {natlh} ("It is objection-
able," or "That is shameful"; literally, "It consumes").
Nonslang counterparts, none of which carries the impact
of {natlh}, might be {quv Hutlh} ("lack honor"), {qab} ("be
bad"), or {Do'Ha'} ("be unfortunate"). The word {'up} ("dis-
gusting, repugnant") may also be used, most commonly
in reference to food or drink. See also {SaS} (literally, "be
horizontal"), another slang term used to voice disap-
proval. Slang terms expressing the opposite of {natlh}---
that is, approval---are {chong} (literally, "be vertical") and
{qu'} (literally, "be fierce").

     {na'} ("be sure, definite, positive, certain")

     The word {na'} literally means "be salty," but its slang
usage is probably influenced by the noun suffix {-na'} [[p.156]]
{{

[[image]]

Worf assures Duras and his associates that they will not have the [[x!]]

}} [[p.157]]
("definite"), which is used when the speaker wants to in-
dicate that he or she is absolutely sure about what is
being said (compare {maghwI,} "traitor," and {maghwI'na'} [[maghwI:=maghwI']]
"definite traitor, without a doubt a traitor"). The slang
word, a verb, is used in such constructions as {jIna'} ("I
am positive [about something I just said]"; literally, "I am
salty"; {jI-,} "I"] and {bIna''a'} ("Are you sure?"; literally, "Are
you salty?" [{bI-,} "you,"; {-'a',} interrogative]). These kinds [[,";:=";]]
of meanings may be expressed without using slang by
employing such verbs as {Honbe'} ("not doubt") or {Sovbej}
("know for certain"). See also {bej}, a slang term with simi-
lar meaning, page 145. [[>>link]]

     {ngIb} ("ankle" [derogatory term])
          See {yeb} ("wrist"); page 166. [[>>link]]

     {ngup} ("authority, power, one in authority, one in
          power, one in charge")

     Literally meaning "cape," this slang term is an exam-
ple of metonymy, whereby one word (or phrase) stands
for another with which it is associated. In this case, the
leader of the Klingon High Council typically wears a cer-
emonial cape. The slang sense of {ngup} does not refer
only to this position on the High Council, however, but
to anyone in power or even to "the power structure."
Someone unsatisfied with the status quo, a rebel, might
be said to want to {ngup qaD} ("challenge those in
charge"; literally, "challenge the cape"). Nonslang equiva-
lents of {ngup} are {woQ} ("authority, political power") and
{qum} ("government").

     {paw'} ("butt heads")

     This verb describes a very common habit among
Klingon warriors, particularly at festive occasions. Two
Klingons stand close together, facing each other, and,
with great joviality, slam their foreheads together. The
word literally means "collide" and is usually (though [[p.158]]
word literally means "collide" and is usually (though [[p.158]]
hardly exclusively) heard when referring to vehicles. In
both its literal and slang usages, {paw'} takes a plural sub-
ject: {paw' tlhIngan SuvwI'pu'} ("The Klingon warriors
butt heads"; literally, "The Klingon warriors collide";
{tlhIngan,} "Klingon"; {SuvwI',} "warrior"; {-pu',} plural suf-
fix); {paw' lupDujHommey} ("The shuttlecraft collide";
{lupDujHom,} "shuttlecraft"; {-mey,} plural suffix). To refer
to a something in motion colliding with something sta-
tionary, a different verb, {ngeQ} ("bump into, collide
with") is used, as in {raS ngeQ tera'ngan} ("The Terran
bumps into the table"; {raS,} "table"; {tera'ngan,} "Terran").
When the subject of {paw'} is persons, the most common
interpretation of the verb is the slang one---that is, "butt
heads." Thus, if one were to say {paw' tera'nganpu'} ("The
Terrans collide"), this would probably be taken to mean
that the Terrans butt heads, as unlikely as the image
might be. When the subject of {paw'} is anything other
than persons, the most likely interpretation is the non-
slang one, "collide." If one wanted to say that two persons
collide but not imply that they butt heads, the verb {ngeQ}
would probably be used along with the suffix {-chuq}
("each other") as in {ngeQchuq tera'nganpu'} ("The Ter-
rans collide with each other"). There is no simple non-
slang verb for "butt heads."

     {pIn} "expert, authority" [["expert, authority":=("expert, authority")]]

     The word {pIn} is literally "boss." In its slang sense, it
is never used alone but always in constructions such as
{'Iw HIq pIn} ("expert on bloodwine, somebody who
knows all about bloodwine"; literally, "bloodwine boss").
The word {pIn} is also found in nonslang terms referring
to crew members on a ship: {QeDpIn} ("science officer"),
{QumpIn} ("communications officer"). It is not known
whether these words originated as slang and became ac-
cepted as the regular terms or whether the use of {pIn}
in the sense of "expert, authority" was modeled after the
words {QeDpIn} and {QumpIn}. Note that for the crew [[p.159]]
terms, in one case {pIn} follows a noun ({QeD,} "science";
thus, {QeDpIn} is "science boss"), but in the other, it fol-
lows what is found elsewhere only as a verb ({Qum,} "com-
municate"), suggesting that there may have been a noun
{Qum} ("communication") at some point in the past. The
nonslang term for an expert is {po'wI'} (literally, "one who
is expert, skilled").

     {qang} ("always agree with [someone], always go
          along with [someone], always cooperate with
          [someone]")

     The literal meaning of the verb {qang} is "pour into,"
though the slang usage is influenced by the verb suffix
{-qang} ("willing"; compare {QaH,} "He/she helps," and
{QaHqang,} "He/she is willing to help"). The slang term
may be found in such sentences as {jIHDaq Daqang}
("You always agree with me, you always cooperate with
me"; literally, "You pour [something] into me"; {jIHDaq,}
"in/at me"; {Daqang,} "You pour [something] into"). To say
that someone "pours" ("always agrees") is somewhat de-
rogatory, implying that the agreeing or cooperating may
be for ulterior motives. Nonslang equivalents of {qang},
though lacking the negative connotation, are {reH
Qochbe'} ("always agree"; {reH,} "always"), {reH yeq} ("al-
ways cooperate"), and {reH jIj} ("always be cooperative").

     {qu'} ("be great, wonderful, excellent, superlative,
          splendid")

     The verb {qu'} literally means "be fierce." In its slang
sense, it may be used adjectivally, as in {taj qu'} ("excellent
knife"; literally, "fierce knife"), or as the main verb in a
sentence, as in {qu' taj} ("the knife is excellent"; literally,
"the knife is fierce"). Though, from the Klingon point of
view, equating being "fierce" with being "great, wonder-
ful," and so on seems quite natural, the slang meaning of
{qu'} probably receives further support because it sounds
just like the verb suffix {-qu',} which is used for emphasis [[p.160]]

}}
(compare {Qatlh,} "difficult," and {Qatlhqu',} "very diffi-
cult"). When applied to people or animals, it is not always
clear whether the slang or nonslang meaning of {qu'} is
intended. That is, {SuvwI' qu'} ("fierce warrior") could be
interpreted literally, or it could mean "excellent warrior."
When applied to anything other than people or animals,
the slang meaning is more likely. Thus, {may' qu'} ("fierce
battle") is really a way of saying "excellent battle." In
Klingon, only a participant in a battle, not the battle it-
self, can literally be described as "fierce." The word {qu'}
may also be used as an exclamation ("Great!" "Wonder-
ful!"). In this sense, it seems to be interchangeable with
{chong} (literally, "be vertical"; see page 148). The slang [[>>link]]
usage of {qu'} is currently extremely common among Klin-
gons, and it has pretty much displaced another slang
term with the same set of meanings ("excellent, wonder- [[p.161]]
ful, etc."), {Huv} (literally, "be clear, not obstructed"),
which was in vogue not all that long ago. The use of {Huv}
for "excellent" is now considered old-fashioned. This is
also the case with {nong} ("passionate"), an even older
slang term for "excellent." (As of this writing, the slang
usage of {nong} seems to be making a comeback, but it
is still too early to say whether this will really happen.)
Nonslang verbs expressing similar ideas are {Dun} ("be
wonderful, great"), {pov} ("be excellent"), and, as an excla-
mation, {maj!} ("Good!").

     {QaD} ("be safe, protected")

     Literally meaning "be dry," the word {QaD} may be ap-
plied to just about anything: a person, object, place, and
so forth. For example, {QaD puq} ("The child is dry")
means that the child is safe; {vengHom QaD} ("dry vil-
lage") means that the village is protected. This slang
meaning may have developed in part because of the Klin-
gon association of water with weakness (as opposed to
the strength of blood or ale, for that matter) and in part
because of the phonetic similarity of {QaD} to {Qan} ("pro-
tect"). In the Krotmag dialect, source of many idiomatic
expressions, {QaD} would be pronounced almost as if {Qan}
(see the chapter on The Fiction of Klingon Conformity,
under "Pronunciation," pages 18--23). [[>>link]]

     {Qom} ("be hazardous, perilous, treacherous")

     The word {Qom} literally means "experience a tremor"
or, using an old Terran phrase, "experience an earth-
quake." The word is used in its slang sense of "perilous,
treacherous" when applied to a mission or voyage. For
example, {Qom Qu'} (literally, "The mission experiences a
tremor") means "The mission is perilous." Likewise,
{Qom He} (literally, "The route experiences a tremor")
generally means "The route is treacherous," implying
that the journey is treacherous. The word can also be ap-
plied to the state of a structure or a vessel following a [[p.162]]
{{

Trafficking with the Romulans shows that B'Etor's (Gwynyth [[x!]]

}} [[p.163]]
disastrous encounter, though in this case the verb usually
takes the perfective suffix {-pu'}, indicating that the action
has been completed. Thus, {Qompu' Duj} (literally, "The
ship has experienced a tremor") may be used to mean
"The ship is hazardous, has been left in a hazardous con-
dition." The fact that in the Krotmag dialect (see the
chapter on The Fiction of Klingon Conformity, under
"Pronunciation," pages 18--23) the word {Qob} ("be dan- [[>>link]]
gerous") would be pronounced {Qom} is probably not un-
related to the origin of the idiomatic usage of {Qom},
though the basic meaning of {Qom} itself certainly carries
with it the notion of potential danger. Note that despite
its slang meaning of "be hazardous, treacherous," the
way the verb is used grammatically is based on its stan-
dard, literal sense. That is, while it is acceptable to say
{He Qob} ("dangerous route"), using {Qob} ("be dangerous")
adjectivally, it is ungrammatical to say {He Qom} for ("per-
ilous route"). The verb {Qom} still means "experience a
tremor" and must be used in a grammatical structure ap-
propriate to that meaning.

     {Qop} ("be dead" [referring to food])

     The word {Qop} means "be worn out" and is usually
applied to old weapons, tools, mechanical devices, and
the like. It is also used to mean "be dead," but only in
reference to an animal that one was expecting to eat live.
If a bowl of dead {qagh} ("<gagh,> serpent worms") is placed
before a Klingon, the disappointed diner will probably
criticize the cook for preparing {qagh Qop} ("dead <gagh">).
The normal way to say "be dead," referring to a person
or animal, is by using the form {Heghpu'} ("has died"):
{Heghpu' SuvwI'} ("The warrior has died"). It is not ap-
propriate to say {SuvwI' Qop} ("dead warrior, worn-out
warrior.")

     {SaS} ("be shallow, superficial, uncritical"; also
          "not good, unfortunate") [[p.164]]

     This word, literally meaning "be horizontal," refers
to someone's intellect. To describe someone as {SaS} is cer-
tainly insulting, as in {SaS DIvI' HoD} ("The Federation
captain is shallow"---that is, literally, "The Federation
captain is horizontal"; {DIvI',} "federation"; {HoD,} "cap-
tain"). This slang expression has apparently been in use
for quite a while and is fairly common. Indeed, for this
usage of the term, there is no known standard equivalent.
{SaS} is also used as an exclamation to express disap-
proval, comparable to the standard {Do'Ha'} ("unfortu-
nate"). For example, upon hearing that a ship has been
destroyed, one may say simply {SaS} (literally, "horizontal"
but suggesting "That's bad, that's unfortunate"). A slang
word with a meaning similar to {SaS} is {natlh} (literally,
"consume, use up" [see page 155]). The opposite mean- [[>>link]]
ing---that is, "profound, thorough" and "good"---is often
expressed by the slang verbs {chong} (literally, "be verti-
cal") and {qo'} (literally, "be fierce"). [[qo':=qu']]

     {SIj} ("be insightful, clever, have a keen mind")

     This verb literally means "slash, slit (with a blade)."
When used in its slang sense, it does not take an object:
{bISIj} ("You are insightful, you have a keen mind"; liter-
ally, "You slash"). Nonslang counterparts are {val} ("be
clever, smart") and {'ong} ("be cunning, sly").

     {Sub} ("be brave, bold, heroic, valiant, intrepid")

     Literally meaning "be solid," as opposed to gaseous
or liquid, {Sub}, in its slang usage, may be applied to a
person. Thus, {SuvwI' Sub} is "brave warrior" (literally,
"solid warrior"; {SuvwI',} "warrior") and {Sub SuvwI'}
means "The warrior is brave" (literally, "The warrior is
solid"). It is inappropriate to use the word to describe
anything other than a person; a phrase such as {may' Sub}
({may',} "battle") would mean only "solid battle" and
would probably be considered a meaningless utterance.
The slang meaning of {Sub} is probably influenced by the [[p.166]]
phonetically identical noun {Sub,} meaning "hero." Non-
slang equivalents for {Sub} are {yoH} ("be brave") and {jaq}
("be bold"), which can be used pretty much interchange-
ably.

     {tlham} ("structure, order")

     The word {tlham}, literally meaning "gravity," is used
to mean "order" or "structure" in the sense of an ordered
or well-structured society. In the same way that gravity
holds one to a planet (or, in the case of artificial gravity,
to the floor of a space vessel), the structure of a society
holds its members in, preventing them from going off in
all directions. In other words, it ensures that a society
function properly by keeping it from coming apart. The
word is used in phrases such as {tlham ghaj} ("have grav-
ity"---that is, "have structure, order") or {tlham Hutlh}
("lack gravity" or "lack structure, order"). A very well or-
dered society may be said to have {tlham'a'} ("big gravity")
or {tlham HoS} ("strong gravity"), while a society that is
judged to be falling apart may have {tlhamHom} ("little
gravity") or {tlham puj} ("weak gravity.") [[."):=").]] [[?? good correction?]]

     {tlhuH} ("be exhilarated, stimulated, invigorated")

     Literally meaning "breathe," this word is used in
such expressions as {jItlhuH} ("I am exhilarated, it's exhil-
arating to me"; literally, "I breathe"). Perhaps a near
equivalent in standard Klingon is {Sey} ("be excited").

     {vonlu'} ("fail utterly")

     This verb literally means "be trapped, entrapped."
The verb {von}, usually translated as "trap, entrap," means
"put (someone) in a position from which there is no es-
cape." For a Klingon, to be in such a position, to be un-
able to fight back, is most dishonorable, especially since
he or she is likely to be viewed in a helpless state. Thus,
it is a sign of utter failure. The slang expression is used
in such constructions as {bIvonlu'pu'} ("You have failed [[p.166]]
completely"; literally, "You have been trapped"). In stan-
dard Klingon, the same idea may be expressed by saying
{lujbej} ("certainly fail"), {lujchu'} ("fail perfectly"), or
{lujqu'} ("really fail"), all based on {luj} ("fail"). Note that {luj}
is also used to mean "lose" (as in "lose at a game"). To say
"I lose" is {jIluj} ({jI-,} "I"); to say "I lose in a big way" is
{jIlujqu'} or {jIlujchu'}. The slang term {vonlu'} is not used
in reference to games. It means "perform most inade-
quately, ineffectually, unsuccessfully" and is applied to
one's performance as a warrior, tactician, political
usurper, and the like.

     {yeb} ("wrist" [derogatory])
     {ngIb} ("ankle" [derogatory])

     The words referring to the joints at the ends of arms
and legs have slightly negative connotations. Likening a
person or situation to either is to say something unflat-
tering. It is not uncommon, therefore, to hear references
to them in insults on the order of {yeb Darur} ("You re-
semble a wrist") or {ngIb ghaH verengan'e'} ("The Fer-
engi is an ankle"). To say {SuvwI' yoH law' ngIb yoH
puS} ("The warrior is braver than an ankle") is far from
complimentary. One theory as to the reason for this nega-
tive association is that wrists and ankles, being joints, are
flexible and pliant, while being rigid---maintaining one's
principles and goals against all odds---is a virtue. A more
likely scenario, however, is that the meanings of the
words were influenced by the distinctive speech of the
Krotmag region, which has been shown to be responsible
for some other common idioms and slang as speakers of
other dialects incorporate certain Krotmag pronuncia-
tions (see the chapter on The Fiction of Klingon Con-
formity, under "Pronunciation," pages 18--23). In the
Krotmag dialect, {yeb} ("wrist") is pronounced {yem}, iden-
tical to the verb {yem} ("sin"). In parallel fashion, {ngIb}
("ankle") is pronounced {ngIm}, identical to the verb {ngIm}
("be putrid"). Thus, the wrist gained an association with [[p.164]]
sinning, or dishonorable behavior; the ankle, with pu-
tridity, perhaps moral decay.

     {yIv} ("annoy, bother, irk, irritate")

     This verb literally means "chew." In its slang sense, it
is found in such constructions as {choyIv} ("You bother
me"---literally, "You chew me"; {cho-,} "You [do something
to] me") or {muyIv romuluS Ha'DIbaH} ("The Romulan
dog irks me"; literally, "The Romulan animal chews me,"
where "Romulan animal" is a derogatory way to refer to
a Romulan; {mu-,} "He/she [does something to] me"; {ro-
muluS,} "Romulus"; {Ha'DIbaH,} "animal"). The subject of
{yIv} can be only a person or creature, not an inanimate
object or a situation. Thus, it is inappropriate to say
something like {muyIv 'Iw HIq bIr} ("cold bloodwine
chews me"; {'Iw HIq,} "bloodwine"; {bIr,} "be cold"). Stan-
dard ways to express the same idea are {nuQ} ("annoy,
bother") and {berghmoH} ("irritate").

     {'Igh} ("be cursed, jinxed")

     This is a slang term with no known origin. It can be
applied to just about anything---persons, missions, ships,
and so on---when everything seems to be going wrong.
Since Klingons consider self-control a great virtue, de-
claring oneself to be cursed is comparable to an admis-
sion of weakness and utterly uncharacteristic (though
not unknown). To say that someone else is cursed, on
the other hand, is to attribute weakness to that person.
Accordingly, {bI'Igh} ("You are cursed, you are jinxed";
{bI-,} "you") is quite insulting. In standard Klingon, the
same idea may be expressed by saying {Do'Ha'moHlu'}
("be made unlucky" or "someone/something causes
[someone/something] to be unlucky"), as in {DaDo'Ha'-
moHlu'} ("You've been made unlucky," or "someone/
something causes you to be unlucky"; {Da-} along with the
impersonal subject suffix {-lu'} means "someone/some-
thing [does something to] you"). [[p.168]]

THE CHANGING RULES:
ACCEPTABLE DEVIATION

     Though not "proper," judging by its frequency of use,
slang would have to be deemed acceptable when used in
appropriate contexts. Similarly, certain departures from
normal grammatical structure are also commonly heard.
These may be categorized into four types. First, some of
these formations are correlated with certain social
groupings, such as social class or generation. These are [[These:=(These]]
discussed in the chapter on The Fiction of Klingon Con-
formity, under "Societal Variation," pages 36--43, and [[>>link]]
this chapter, under "Generational Differences: Pronunci-
ation and Grammar," pages 138--142). Second, some in- [[).:=.)]] [[>>link]]
stances of grammatical variation, even though generally
regarded as errors, seem to be rather mild infractions.
Some of these may well become acceptable at some time
in the future, much to the chagrin of the more traditional
members of Klingon society. Third, some nonstandard
varieties of language are used quite frequently and by
most Klingons, but only in a restricted set of circum-
stances. Finally, some deviations are definitely ungram-
matical but are not errors; they are uttered with full
knowledge and understanding of what the rules pre-
scribe, perhaps a sort of grammatical slang. These con-
structions are used in restricted contexts or for rhetorical
effect or both.


Common Errors: The Case of <lu->

     Among the more tolerated grammatical errors is one
involving the pronominal prefix {lu-}, whose use is rather
complex. In colloquial Klingon, however, it is sometimes
not used in instances in which grammar books would say
it is required. It is well known that Klingon pronominal
prefixes indicate both the subject and object of the verb.
For example, the prefix {mu-} means that the subject (per- [[p.169]]
{{

[[image]]

The Jem'Hadar have made the error of underestimating a Klingon [[x!]]
warrior. <Robbie Robinson> [[x!]]

}} [[p.170]]
former of the action) is "he/she" or "they" and that the
object (recipient of the action) is "me," as in {muHIv} ("He/
she attacks me," or "they attack me"; {HIv,} "attack"). The
subject of a sentence with {muHIv}, then, could be {SuvwI'}
("warrior") or {SuvwI'pu'} ("warriors"): {muHIv SuvwI'}
("The warrior attacks me"), {muHIv SuvwI'pu'} ("The
warriors attack me"). If the object in these sentences is
"you" (singular) instead of "me," there are two different
prefixes, depending on whether the attacker is singular
or plural: {Du-} ("He/she [does something to] you") and {nI-}
("They [do something to] you"), as in {DuHIv} ("He/she
attacks you"), {nIHIv} ("They attack you"). These verb
forms are correctly used in such sentences as {DuHIv
SuvwI'} ("The warrior attacks you") and {nIHIv Suv-
wI'pu'} ("The warriors attack you"). It is ungrammatical
to use {Du-} with a plural subject or {nI-} with a singular
subject. That is, both {DuHIv SuvwI'pu'} ("The warriors
attacks you") and {nIHIv SuvwI'} ("The warrior attack
you") are as inappropriate as their Federation Standard
translations.
     When the subject of the verb is third person ("he, she,
it, they") and there is either no object or else the object is
also third person, except for imperatives, there is usually
no prefix attached to the verb. Thus, {HIv}---the verb alone,
with no prefix---could mean "He/she attacks," "They at-
tack," "He/she attacks him/her," "He/she attacks them,"
or "They attack them." When the third person subject is
plural but the object is singular, however, the prefix {lu-}
is used: {luHIv} ("they attack him/her"). In short, no prefix
should be attached to the verb unless a plural subject acts
upon a singular object:

     {HIv tlhIngan.} ("The Klingon attacks"; {tlhIngan,}
          "Klingon")
     {HIv tlhInganpu'.} ("The Klingons attack";
          {tlhInganpu',} "Klingons")
     {romuluSngan HIv tlhIngan.} ("The Klingon
          attacks the Romulan"; {romuluSngan,}
          "Romulan") [[p.171]]
     {romuluSnganpu' HIv tlhIngan.} ("The Klingon
          attacks the Romulans"; {romuluSnganpu',}
          "Romulans")
     {romuluSnganpu' HIv tlhInganpu'.} ("The
          Klingons attack the Romulans.")

but:

     {romuluSngan luHIv tlhInganpu'.} ("The
          Klingons attack the Romulan.")

     If the indefinite subject suffix {-lu'} (phonetically simi-
lar, but unrelated to the prefix) is used, indicating that
someone or something unknown or unstated performs
the action, things get a little more complicated. In these
instances, the prefix {lu-} indicates that the <object> is plural:
{romuluSnganpu' luHIvlu'} ("Someone attacks the Ro-
mulans," or "The Romulans are attacked").
     Because Klingon nouns may be plural even if they
lack a plural suffix ({-pu'} in the examples above), some-
times sentences, if taken out of context, are ambiguous.
Thus, {romuluSngan HIv tlhIngan} could, theoretically,
mean "The Klingon attacks the Romulan," "The Klingon
attacks the Romulans," or "The Klingons attack the Ro-
mulans." It could not mean "The Klingons attack the Ro-
mulan," however, because that meaning would require
the prefix {lu-} on the verb: {romuluSngan luHIv tlhIngan}.
Since the subject and object are not otherwise distin-
guished as singular or plural, {lu-} is what makes the
meaning clear. Similarly, if the verb has the indefinite
subject suffix {-lu'} and the object of the sentence lacks a
plural suffix, only the presence of the prefix {lu-} makes it
clear that it is plural: {romuluSngan luHIvlu'} ("Someone
attacks the Romulans," or "The Romulans are attacked").
     In those instances, however, when clarity is not an
issue---that is, if the object is unambiguously singular
(when the subject is known) or unambiguously plural
(when the subject is indefinite)---the prefix {lu-} is some- [[p.172]]
times left off: {wa' romuluSngan HIv tlhInganpu'} ("The
Klingons attack one Romulan"; {wa',} "one"); {romulu- [[romulu-:=romuluS]]
Snganpu' HIvlu'} ("Someone attacks the Romulans," or [[Snganpu':=nganpu']]
"The Romulans are attacked"). Though this makes the
sentences fall in line with other third-person subject/
third-person object sentences in that there is no verb pre-
fix, these are still regarded as errors; the correct sen-
tences are {wa' romuluSngan luHIv tlhInganpu'} and
{romuluSnganpu' luHIvlu'.} Except in formal situations,
however, the omission of {lu-} in such cases is often over-
looked. Though technically an error, and jarring to many
Klingons' ears, it causes no confusion as to the intended
meaning of the sentence. It is important to note that this
does not mean that the use of {lu-} is optional; it is left off
only under specific conditions.
     Klingon grammarians refer to the rule that governs
the use of pronominal prefixes as the rule of {rom} (liter-
ally, "accord"). Grammarians of Federation Standard and
many Earth languages call the phenomenon "agree-
ment." Thus, in the case of Klingon, the prefix used must
"agree" with the noun to which it refers; if the object
noun is plural, for example, the prefix must be one that is
used with plural objects. Agreeing is not a trait typically
associated with Klingon nature, however, and appar-
ently, at least under certain circumstances, this may ex-
tend to grammar as well.


Restricted Contexts: Clipped Klingon

     One form of nonstandard speech that is heard rather
frequently is what is called {tlhIngan Hol poD} ("Clipped
Klingon") or simply {Hol poD} ("clipped language"). In
Clipped Klingon, certain grammatical elements are left
out, but sentences otherwise match the standard forma-
tions. Clipped Klingon differs from those patterns associ-
ated with a particular generation or social class or found
only in certain regions, however, because it is restricted [[p.173]]
{{

[[image]]

The battle to save the <Starship Defiant>
demonstrates a Klingon proverb to Worf. <Elliott Marks>

}}
contextually. That is, it is associated not with certain
groups of speakers but instead with certain situations. In
particular, Clipped Klingon is heard in situations where
quick communication is desirable and certain phrases
are expected to be heard, such as on the bridge of a ship
during a battle.
     The element most likely to be missing from a Clipped
Klingon utterance is the pronominal prefix. Thus, {yaj'a'}
(consisting of the verb {yaj} ["understand"] plus {-'a'}, the
interrogative suffix) would mean "Does he or she under-
stand?" in Standard Klingon but could also mean "Do
you understand?" in Clipped Klingon, with the pronomi-
nal prefix {bI-} ("you" [singular]) or {Su-} ("you" [plural]) left
off.
     Precisely because certain elements are absent,
Clipped Klingon phrases cannot be properly interpreted [[p.174]]
unless the meaning that would have been expressed by
the missing pieces is understood by all involved in the
conversation. Accordingly, Clipped Klingon is typically
used only in such situations. For example, a captain's
command to fire a torpedo is most commonly just {baH!}
("Fire [a torpedo]!") rather than {yIbaH!,} the full form
with the imperative prefix {yI-,} or even the lengthier and
more explicit {peng yIbaH!} ("Fire the torpedo!") In the
throes of battle, by the time the order to fire a torpedo is
given, all concerned are expecting to hear that order. The
torpedo has already been loaded into the torpedo tube,
the weapon has been aimed, and the firing mechanism
has been readied. All that is left is for the gunner to actu-
ally discharge the weapon. Thus, the only information
that must be conveyed at this point is when to fire; the
person doing the firing and the object to be fired are al-
ready known by all. Clipped Klingon accommodates this
need quite nicely.
     On the other hand, it would be inappropriate to use
Clipped Klingon when first ordering a drink at a bar. To
approach the bartender and say simply {qang!} ("Pour!")
does not convey enough information. What should be
poured? Does the speaker want the bartender to pour the
drink, or does the speaker want to do it him- or herself?
Once a context has been established, however, the
clipped command form works adequately. Thus, if the
bartender has already poured two or three glasses of
bloodwine for a patron and these have been consumed,
the customer's shout of {qang!} would probably be cor-
rectly interpreted as "Pour me one more drink of blood-
wine!"
     The role of context in determining whether to use
Clipped Klingon is both crucial and subtle. For example,
in the bar scenario mentioned above, to order an addi-
tional drink by saying {'Iw HIq yIqang!} ("Pour the blood-
wine!") rather than simply {qang!} ("Pour!") carries no
particular connotation. On the other hand, if the patron [[p.175]]
had used the clipped form on one or more occasions and,
for some reason, was displeased with the bartender's re-
sponse, use of the longer form the next time would con-
vey this annoyance, as if to say, "I will be very explicit so
there is no misunderstanding this time: pour the blood-
wine." Such a switch from Clipped Klingon to the fuller
form is often interpreted as a challenge to one's honor,
so it should not be done unless one is prepared to deal
with the consequences.
     Clipped Klingon is also frequently found in song lyr-
ics. There are two possible reasons for this. First, songs
are often associated with situations in which spoken
(that is, not sung) Clipped Klingon would probably be
found, such as battles and drinking. Second, resorting to
Clipped Klingon may make it easier to fit the words of a
song to the melody. For example, in a song traditionally
sung by Klingon warriors at the beginning of a mission
(sometimes called "The Warrior's Anthem" or "{SuvwI'
van bom"}), the opening lines are in Clipped Klingon: [["}:=}"]]

     {Qoy qeylIS puqloD}
     {Qoy puqbe'pu'}

Compare these with the nonclipped version:

     {peQoy qeylIS puqloD}
     {peQoy puqbe'pu'}

These lines mean "Hear, sons of Kahless!/Hear, daugh-
ters!" In the song, the first word in each line is {Qoy}
("hear"), a command in clipped form; the imperative pre-
fix {pe-} is left off.
     Actually, these lyrics are an illustration of another
way context is important when using clipped Klingon. In [[clipped:=Clipped]]
theory, the full form of the clipped verb {Qoy} ("hear")
could be either {yIQoy} or {peQoy.} The prefix {yI-} indicates
a command when addressing one person; {pe-} is used
when addressing a group. The phrase {qeylIS puqloD} by
itself is ambiguous; it means either "son of Kahless" or [[p.176]]
"sons of Kahless" ({qeylIS,} "Kahless"; {puqloD,} "son") be-
cause nouns in Klingon, even if intended to refer to more
than one, do not require a plural suffix. Thus, the clipped
phrase {Qoy qeylIS puqloD} may mean either "Hear, son
of Kahless!" or "Hear, sons of Kahless!" In the context of
the song, however, it is clear that the plural meaning is
intended since in the second line, the word {puqbe'pu'}
("daughters") has the plural suffix {-pu'} and is not ambig-
uous at all. If the lyrics were sung in their nonclipped
form, with the prefix {pe-} used with the verb {Qoy,} there
would be no misunderstanding. Even though {puqloD}
alone is "son" or "sons," {peQoy qeylIS puqloD,} contain-
ing the prefix {pe-,} which is used only with plural address-
ees, could mean only "Hear, sons of Kahless!"


Intentional Ungrammaticality

     Sometimes words or phrases are coined for a specific
occasion, intentionally violating grammatical rules in
order to have an impact. Usually these are never heard
again, though some gain currency and might as well be
classified as slang. Klingon grammarians call such forms
{mu'mey ru'} ("temporary words"). Sometimes, {mu'mey
ru'} fill a void---that is, give voice to an idea for which
there is no standard (or even slang) expression; some-
times, like slang, they are just more emphatic ways of
expressing an idea. A common way to create these con-
structions is to bend the grammatical rules somewhat,
violating the norm in a way that is so obvious that there
is no question that it is being done intentionally. To do
this is expressed in Klingon as {pabHa'} ("misfollow [the
rules], follow [the rules] wrongly").
     Several of these made-up words involve construc-
tions normally restricted to numbers. The suffix {-DIch} is
attached to a number to form an ordinal number: {wa'}
("one"), {wa'DIch} ("first"); {cha'} ("two"), {cha'DIch} ("sec-
ond"); {vagh} ("five"), {vaghDIch} ("fifth"). Ordinal numbers [[p.177]]
follow the noun with which they are associated, as in
{'avwI' vaghDIch} ("fifth guard"), {nentay wa'DIch} ("First
Rite of Ascension"). Sometimes the suffix is heard
attached to {pagh} ("zero, none"), producing the techni-
cally ungrammatical term {paghDIch} ("zeroth"). It is
used to describe something that was expected to occur
but has not, or that could conceivably occur but has not.
For example, one might say {pawpu' 'avwI' paghDIch}
("the zeroth guard has arrived"; {pawpu',} "has arrived"),
implying that no guard has arrived even though one (and
probably more than one) is expected. Similarly, one
might describe how to wield a painstik during the Rite of
Ascension by saying:

     {'oy'naQ DaQeqDI' mIw wa'DIch Data',} '{ach} [[} '{ach}:= 'ach]]
          '{oy'naQ Dachu'DI' mIw paghDIch Data'.} [['{oy'naQ:='oy'naQ]]
          ("When you aim the painstik, you accomplish
          the first step, but when you turn the painstik
          on, you accomplish the zeroth step"; '{oy'naQ,} [['{oy'naQ,}:={'oy'naQ,}]]
          "painstik"; {DaQeqDI',} "when you aim it";
          {mIw,} "procedure"; {wa'DIch,} "first"; {Data',}
          "You accomplish it"; '{ach,} "but"; {Dachu'DI',} [['{ach,}:={'ach,}]]
          {"}when you activate it") [[{"}:="]]

The implication here is that activating the painstik must
be done before beginning the ritualistic part of the cere-
mony.
     On the other extreme, when {-DIch} is attached to
{Hoch} ("all"), the resulting word, {HochDIch} ("allth") is
used as an alternate for {Qav} ("be final, last") to refer to
the final one of a series whose members either were
counted or could have been counted, as in {pIpyuS pach
HochDIch DaSoppu'} ("You've eaten the last <pipius>
claw"; {pIpyuS pach,} "<pipius> claw"; {DaSoppu',} "You've
eaten it"). The word also may be used to describe the final
step of a process. Speaking of the Rite of Ascension, one
might say '{oy'naQ Dachu'Ha'DI' mIw HochDIch Data'} [['{oy'naQ:={'oy'naQ]]
("When you turn the painstik off, you accomplish the last
step"; {Dachu'Ha'DI', "}when you deactivate it"). [[, "}:=,} "]] [[p.178]]
     The suffix {-logh,} when attached to numbers, is used
to count the number of instances of something: {wa'logh}
("once"), {cha'logh} ("twice"), {vaghlogh} ("five times").
When {-logh} is attached to {pagh} ("zero"), the resulting
form, {paghlogh} ("zero times") is used as an emphatic
alternate for {not} ("never"), as in {paghlogh jegh tlhIngan
SuvwI'} ("a Klingon warrior surrenders zero times"; {jegh,}
"surrender"; {SuvwI',} "warrior"; {tlhIngan,} "Klingon");
compare {not jegh tlhIngan SuvwI'} ("a Klingon warrior
never surrenders"). Similarly, when {-logh} is attached to
{Hoch} ("all"), the resulting word, {Hochlogh} ("all times"),
is used in the same way as {reH} ("always"), as in {Hoch-
logh no' yIquvmoH} ("All times honor your ancestors";
{no',} "ancestors"; {yIquvmoH,} "Honor them!" [actually,
this is "Honor him/her!"; the inherently plural noun {no',}
"ancestors," takes a singular pronoun]); compare {reH
no' yIquvmoH} ("Always honor your ancestors").
     Another kind of bending of the grammar involves the
comparative construction---that is, the way to say that
something is more or greater than something else. In
Klingon, this is expressed by a grammatical formula: A Q
{law'} B Q {puS}, where A and B are the two items being
compared as to a specific quality (Q), A having the
greater amount of this quality (expressed by {law'}, "be
many"), B the lesser (expressed by {puS,} "be few"): {tlhI-
ngan yoH law' verengan yoH puS} ("The Klingon is
braver than the Ferengi"; {tlhIngan,} "Klingon"; {yoH,} "be
brave"; {verengan,} "Ferengi"). As a form of word play,
antonyms (that is, words with opposite meanings) other
than {law'} and {puS} are sometimes plugged into the for-
mula. The resulting phrases literally make no sense at all,
but because of the uniqueness of the {law'}/{puS} phrases
within Klingon grammar, they are always understood.
Constructions such as the following might be heard, all
meaning, though not literally, "The Klingon is braver
than the Ferengi": [[p.179]]

     {tlhIngan yoH HoS verengan yoH puj.} ({HoS,} "be
          strong"; {puj,} "be weak")
     {tlhIngan yoH pIv verengan yoH rop.} ({pIv,} "be
          healthy"; {rop,} "be sick")
     {tlhIngan yoH Daj verengan yoH qetlh} ({Daj,} "be [[qetlh:=qetlh.]]
          interesting"; {qetlh,} "be dull")

     Such fanciful use of words is found with the superla-
tive construction (something is the most or the best) as
well. In the superlative, the noun {Hoch} ("all") fits into the
B slot, as in the normal sentence {tlhIngan yoH law'
Hoch yoH puS} ("Klingons are the bravest of all"). It is
possible, however, for rhetorical effect, to say such things
as {tlhIngan yoH HoS Hoch yoH puj} ({HoS,} "be strong";
{puj,} "be weak").
     If one state of affairs is not inherently better or worse
than its opposite, the terms may occur in either order.
Once again comparing the brave Klingon and the not-so- [[keep hyphen]]
brave Ferengi:

     {tlhIngan yoH jen verengan yoH 'eS} or {tlhIngan
          yoH 'eS verengan yoH jen} ({jen,} "be high";
          {'eS,} "be low")
     {tlhIngan yoH ghegh verengan yoH Hab} or
          {tlhIngan yoH Hab verengan yoH ghegh}
          ({ghegh,} "be rough"; {Hab,} "be smooth")

     Some conditions, on the other hand, are more highly
regarded than others. In those instances, it is essential to
get the terms in the correct order. For example, among
Klingons, a task that is difficult ({Qatlh}) is more highly
valued than one that is easy ({ngeD}). Accordingly, in these
creative comparative and superlative constructions,
{Qatlh} is associated with the quality that is "many" and
{ngeD} with the quality that is "few." To say "The Klingon
is braver than the Ferengi," one would have to say {tlhI-
ngan yoH Qatlh verengan yoH ngeD}. Reversing the
order of {Qatlh} and {ngeD} would produce the phrase [[p.180]]
{tlhIngan yoH ngeD verengan yoH Qatlh,} which, if in-
terpretable at all, would mean "The Klingon is less brave
than the Ferengi." Even if one really meant it, uttering
such a phrase could lead to unfortunate consequences.
     Some speakers of Klingon never use such noncon-
formist constructions. Some use a few from a stock set.
Others seem to be somewhat creative. Among Klingons,
there is a fine line between creative use of the language
and silliness, however, and Klingons are rather intoler-
ant of the latter. Accordingly, the visitor to a Klingon
planet is advised to avoid making such constructions
until he or she is very well versed in Klingon culture. Not
only will this preclude being viewed as less than serious,
it will also prevent inadvertently making comparisons
backward.
     A final type of intentional ungrammaticality may
occur as a result of an attempt to circumvent a grammat-
ical rule. One such rule involves the manner in which
verb suffixes may or may not be used together in the
same word. Excluding a small set of suffixes that may
occur just about anywhere, if a verb has more than one
suffix, the order of the suffixes is fixed. For example, if
both {-nIS} ("need") and {-bej} ("certainly") occur in the
same word, {-nIS} must always precede {-bej}, as in {maSop-
nISbej} ("We certainly need to eat"; {ma-,} "we"; {Sop,}
"eat"). Putting the suffixes in the wrong order, as in {ma-
SopbejnIS}, produces an unacceptable form (just as <talk-
ser> is an ungrammatical way to make the plural of <talker>
in Federation Standard; only <talkers> is acceptable). In ad-
dition, there are suffixes that can never occur in the same
word; they can neither precede nor follow one another.
For instance, one cannot use {-nIS} ("need"), as in {maSop-
nIS} ("We need to eat") and {-rup} ("ready"), as in {ma-
Soprup} ("We are ready to eat"), in the same word, just
as in Federation Standard one cannot use both <-s> (third- [[keep hyphen]]
person present-tense indicator), as in <talks,> and <-ed> (past- [[keep hyphen]]
tense indicator), as in <talked,> in the same word. Saying [[p.181]]
{maSoprupnIS} or {maSopnISrup} is as impossible to a
Klingon speaker as saying <talksed> or <talkeds> would be to
a speaker of Federation Standard.
     Among those suffixes that can never occur together
are {-lu'} (indefinite subject indicator) and {-laH} ("can,
able"). The former is used when the subject is unknown
or indefinite, often translated into Federation Standard
by means of the passive voice: {jagh jonlu'} ("One captures
the enemy," or "The enemy is captured"; {jagh,} "enemy";
{jon,} "capture"). The latter is used to express ability: {jagh
jonlaH} ("He/she can capture the enemy"). If it is desir-
able to express the ideas of "indefinite subject" and "abil-
ity" at the same time, such as in the sentences "One can
capture the enemy" or "The enemy can be captured," it is
not uncommon to use the noun {vay'} ("somebody, any-
body") as the subject of the sentence: {jagh jonlaH vay'}
("Somebody can capture the enemy," or "Anybody can
capture the enemy"). Nevertheless, some speakers seem
to want to put the two concepts into a single word, and,
on rare occasion, they will do so. Rather than violating
the rules by using the two suffixes sequentially (that is,
{-lu'laH} or {-laHlu'}), however, these speakers will say ei-
ther {-luH} or {-la'}, employing totally artificial, made-up
suffixes formed by fusing {-lu'} and {-laH}, as in {jagh jon-
luH} or {jagh jonla'} ("The enemy can be captured"). No
one accepts such constructions as grammatical; their in-
appropriateness, the way they grate on the Klingon ear,
is exactly what gives them elocutionary clout. A visitor
may hear one of these odd suffixes occasionally, but, as
with other intentionally ungrammatical forms, it is best
to avoid using them until one is extremely comfortable
with the nuances of Klingon style.


Ritualized Speech

     As noted earlier (in the chapter on The Fiction of
Klingon Conformity, pages 7--43), in some ritualistic set- [[>>link]] [[p.182]]
tings tradition overrides any tendency for change or vari-
ation. The language of such ceremonies, {no' Hol}
("ancestors' language"), has not changed for centuries,
though different forms of {no' Hol} are heard, depending
on when the ceremony originated. For other rituals, how-
ever, the standard version of modern Klingon, {ta' Hol}, is
used. Even though the words and grammar are the same
as those used in everyday speech, in ritualistic settings,
the sentences are set. Each Klingon who undergoes the
Rite of Ascension, for example, follows the same script,
beginning with {DaHjaj SuvwI''e' jIH} ("Today I am a
warrior"). The lines must be said in the same way each
time, with little room for variation. Over time, as the lan-
guage changes, the current versions of these phrases may
become fossilized and be considered examples of {no'
Hol}, but for the time being, they are just highly formal
examples of Standard Klingon.
     One type of occasion on which ritualized speech is
heard is the induction ceremony or initiation rite ({muv-
tay}). For example, in the ceremony to induct new mem-
bers into the Order of the <Bat'leth> ({betleH 'obe'}), the
highest honor that the government bestows on a Klingon,
the presiding official, usually the leader of the Klingon
High Council, first reads a name from the {naD tetlh}
("Commendation List"), always calling out the inductee's
name in the most formal way (given name plus father's
name, such as {tI'vIS barot puqloD} ["T'vis, son of
Barot"]). The inductee approaches, and the official
says---with no variation---{pInaDqu' tuqlIj wInaDqu' je}
("Glory to you and your house"; literally, "We praise you
highly; we also praise your house highly").
     A ritual of a less majestic sort occurs on a Klingon
vessel when a new set of officers takes over and a mission
is about to begin. With the bridge crew assembled but
the captain not yet present, the first officer states his or
her name and then says {DaH yaS wa'DIch vIgheS} ("I
now take my place as first officer" or, literally, "Now I [[p.183]]
{{

}} [[p.184]]
assume the responsibilities of first officer"; {DaH,} "now";
{yaS wa'DIch,} "first officer"; {vIgheS,} "I assume the duties
of, I take on the responsibilities of"). The first officer then
requests the ship's {may' ta} ("record of battle"), which is
presented by a crew member. The first officer reviews it.
Soon the captain enters. The first officer says, {beq may'
ta vIlajpu'} ("I have accepted the crew's record of battle";
{beq,} "crew"; {vIlajpu',} "I have accepted it"), pledges the
crew's lives to the captain, and concludes by saying,
{juDev 'ej Dujvam ra'wI' DagheS 'e' vItlhob} ("I ask you
to lead us as commander of this ship" or, literally, "I re-
quest that you lead us and that you assume the duties of
commander of this ship"; {juDev,} "You lead us"; {'ej,}
"and"; {Dujvam,} "this ship"; {ra'wI',} "commander";
{DagheS,} "You assume the duties of"; {'e',} "that"; {vItlhob,}
"I request it"). The captain replies, {ghopDu'wIjDaq yIn-
meyraj vIlaj} ("I accept your lives into my hands"; {ghop-
Du'wIjDaq,} "in my hands"; {yInmeyraj,} "your lives";
{vIlaj,} "I accept them") and then reverts to the ancient
language form {no' Hol} and says, {Delaq Do'}, meaning
something like "Take your stations," a phrase never heard
in any other context.
     Finally, another sort of ritualized speech consists of
ways of starting or concluding conversations. Though, as
is well known, there are really no Klingon greetings along
the lines of "hello," "how're things?" or the like, Klingons
sometimes begin a conversation by saying {nuqneH}, an
idiomatic expression meaning "What do you want?" (If
fully grammatical, "What do you want?" would be ren-
dered as {nuq DaneH}.) The usual response to {nuqneH} is
neither a repetition of the expression nor is it an answer
to the question. There is often no particular response at
all; the "greeted" party simply begins speaking about the
topic at hand. Sometimes the response is {yIjatlh!}
("Speak!"), after which the person who began the conver-
sation continues. If the addressee has reason to be angry
with the "greeter," the most likely response is silence. The [[p.185]]
lack of a response is not necessarily an indication of ill
will, however; it may just be that the person to whom
{nuqneH} is said can think of nothing to say and is waiting
for the greeter to go on.
     Similarly, at the end of a conversation, there is no
Klingon equivalent for "good-bye" or "catch you later" or
"have a nice day." If anything of a concluding nature is
said at all, however, it will certainly be {Qapla'} ("suc-
cess"), a customary send-off that has its origins in ship
captains' dispatching their crews on dangerous and,
most assuredly, glorious missions. [[p.186]]

AVOIDING GAFFES

Despite the diversity exhibited by speakers of Klin-
gon who belong to different groups or who come
from different parts of the Empire, despite the accept-
ability of different pronunciations, terminology, and
even grammar, there are still some aspects of language
use for which the speaker must be sure to adhere to all
the rules rather meticulously. For example, care must be
taken when pronouncing some words and phrases to en-
sure that they cannot be mistaken for other words or
phrases with completely different meanings. When
choosing words, one must be aware that there are expres-
sions that may be used when speaking to certain people
but must be avoided when speaking to others. In addi-
tion, when translating to or from Klingon, there are some
concepts that tend to cause a certain amount of difficulty
simply because there are no words for the concept in one
or the other of the languages. This may result in ungram-
matical constructions whose use clearly marks one as an
outsider and therefore probably as one not to be trusted.
It is important for anyone visiting a Klingon settlement
to be aware that saying the wrong thing or saying it in
the wrong way may not only lead to communication dif-
ficulties but also may be detrimental to one's health. [[p.188]]


PHONETIC PERILS

     When learning to speak a new language, one has a
tendency to pronounce sounds in a familiar, comfortable
way, as if they were sounds in a language already spoken.
For example, someone who speaks Federation Standard
may mispronounce Klingon {q} as <k> because the two
sounds are similar and the Federation Standard speaker
is accustomed to making the <k> sound toward the back of
the mouth but is not accustomed to making a {q} sound
even farther back. In the same fashion, a Federation
Standard speaker may mispronounce Klingon {D}, made
with the tip of the tongue touching the roof of the mouth,
as if it were the similar but not identical Federation Stan-
dard <d>, made with the tip of the tongue somewhat behind
the upper teeth. Unless the Federation Standard speaker
learns to overcome old habits, then, he or she is likely to
pronounce the word {qoD} ("interior"), which has unfamil-
iar consonants, as if it were Federation Standard <code>.
To pronounce Klingon words with Federation Standard
sounds is to speak Klingon with a Federation Standard
accent. For the most part, speaking Klingon with an alien
accent will not lead to any misunderstanding. If one were
to say <pa code> for Klingon {pa' qoD} ("room's interior, in-
side of a room"), one's pronunciation would betray his or
her non-Klingon status, and one would risk being judged
too lazy to learn Klingon properly, but the idea of "inside
of a room" would still be conveyed.
     Mispronunciation may turn dangerous, on the other
hand, if one Klingon sound is substituted for another.
This is most likely to happen if both of the sounds are
initially unfamiliar to the language learner---that is, if
they are lacking from the learner's native tongue. For ex-
ample, the Klingon sounds {H} and {Q} are not found in Fed-
eration Standard, and some students of Klingon at first
have a hard time distinguishing the two, even though
they are, to a Klingon's ear, quite distinct. (The {Q} has a
sudden onset, is produced farther back in the mouth, and
is louder than is {H}.) If {Q} is misused for {H} or vice versa, [[p.189]]
one might accidentally say {bIjeH} ("You are absent-
minded") when one intends to say {bIjeQ} ("You are self- [[keep hyphen]]
confident"), or perhaps one will issue the command {yI-
Qotlh!} ("Disable it!") when one intends {yIHotlh!} ("Scan
it!") Depending on the circumstances, such utterances
could be fatal errors for the speaker.
     Sometimes even sounds familiar to a language
learner cause problems. Federation Standard speakers
generally have no problem distinguishing the Klingon
vowel sounds {e} and {I} simply because these sounds are
distinct in Federation Standard as well (for example, <pet>
versus <pit>). Nevertheless, when one is learning Klingon
words, it is not uncommon to confuse words with {e} with
words with {I}, just as in some dialects of Federation Stan-
dard <pen> and <pin> sound pretty much alike. All too fre-
quently, one hears rumors about the fate of a student of
Klingon who intended to say {yo' qIj} ("Black Fleet") but
accidentally said {yo' qej} ("grouchy fleet") instead. (In
Klingon mythology, the Black Fleet is a band consisting
of warriors who have died bravely and honorably and, in
a sort of afterlife, carry on glorious battles forever.)
     As a practical matter, most mispronunciations will
not cause problems, simply because context will make
one word rather than the other the only possible choice.
Thus, if the occupant of a room heard a door chime,
there would probably be no misunderstanding as a result
of his or her saying {yI'Il!} ("Be sincere!") rather than the
correct {yI'el!} ("Enter!"). In the situation at hand, only
"Enter!" makes any sense. Sometimes grammar makes
the context clear. For example, saying {joQpu'} rather than
{joHpu'} for "Lords, Ladies" ({joH,} "Lord, Lady"; {-pu',} plu-
ral suffix) probably would not be misinterpreted as say-
ing "ribs" ({joQ,} "rib") because the plural suffix {-pu'} is
used only with nouns indicating beings capable of using
language. The reverse is likewise true. That is, if one said
{joHDu'} rather than {joQDu'} for "ribs," the meaning of
"ribs" would probably be understood because the plural [[p.190]]
suffix {-Du'} is used only for body parts. In identical fash-
ion, mispronouncing {joHwI'} ("my Lord" or "my Lady")
as {joQwI'} would probably not cause the listener to think
that "my rib" was the intended meaning, because the suf-
fix {-wI'} ("my") is used only with nouns capable of using
language. The suffix meaning "my" used with other
nouns is {-wIj}, as in {joQwIj} ("my rib"). To stay out of trou-
ble, however, it is important to get the grammar right.
If, for instance, one did not understand the appropriate
usages of the plural suffixes {-pu'} versus {-Du'} or of the
possessive suffixes {-wI'} versus {-wIj}, there could be unfor-
tunate repercussions even if one's pronunciation were
perfect. Addressing "my Lord" or "my Lady" as {joHwIj}
rather than {joHwI'} is insulting indeed, since it implies
that "my Lord" or "my Lady" is a lower order of being.
Similarly, a group of heads of households would proba-
bly not appreciate being referred to as {joHDu'}, since that
would be the appropriate way to say "Lords" or "Ladies"
only if they were body parts. The only thing worse would
be combining mispronunciation with grammatical blun-
dering, such as by saying {joQDu'wIj} ("my ribs")---with {Q}
rather than {H,} {-Du'} rather than {-pu'}, and {-wIj} rather
than {-wI'}---when {joHpu'wI'} ("my Lords, my Ladies") is
intended. Mistakes of this kind are simply not tolerated
and there are no recorded instances of anyone living long
enough to repeat the offense.
     Of course, not all pronunciation errors are egregious.
Some produce semantically peculiar utterances and,
therefore, are usually recognizable as errors. Thus, if a
would-be captain were to shout {yIbaQ!} rather than
{yIbaH!} ("Fire [the torpedo]!"; {baH,} "fire [a torpedo]"), he
or she would be saying "Be just picked!" The conse-
quences of such an error would be trivial, however, since
the verb {baQ} ("be fresh, just picked") applies only to fruit
or vegetables and is utterly incongruous in the context of
torpedo launching. Indeed, since {yIbaH} is what one
would expect to hear in such a situation, the mispronun-
ciation would probably go unnoticed or else be consid-
ered a mere slip of the tongue. [[p.191]]
     On the other hand, one should not rely on context or
semantic weirdness as always being available to bail one
out of a sticky situation that results from articulating a
word incorrectly. When dealing with Klingons, it is safest
to avoid putting oneself in such a situation in the first
place by being aware of which mispronunciations one is
most likely to make. To that end, the following sections
contain pairs of words and phrases of which to be partic-
ularly wary. The lists are by no means complete and are
weighted in favor of the mistakes most common among
those whose first language is Federation Standard. The
best course of action for a visitor to a Klingon planet is
to assume that all mispronunciations lead to trouble and
to be careful with enunciation under all circumstances.

          {tlhIlHal yIngIv!} ("Patrol the mine!") [[p.192]]

     {regh} ("bleed")/{rIgh} ("be lame")
          {regh SuvwI'.} ("The warrior bleeds.")
          {rIgh SuvwI'.} ("The warrior is lame.")

Note that for a Klingon warrior, bleeding is an indication
of a particularly exhilarating battle, not a symbol of de-
feat. A lame warrior, on the other hand, is often consid-
ered an object of pity.
     Care in pronunciation may extend to grammatical el-
ements as well. Thus, {qaleghneS} ("I see you honorably"
or, perhaps more naturally, "I am honored to see you";
{qalegh,} "I see you"), which ends in the honorific suffix
{-neS}, is different in meaning from {qaleghnIS} ("I need to
see you"), which ends in the suffix {-nIS} ("need, must").
Furthermore, since {-neS} is used only in addressing a su-
perior, saying {-neS} rather than {-nIS} may be bestowing
honor inappropriately.

          {wa'leS jIcheH.} ("Tomorrow I will defect.")

     {ghew} ("bug")/{Hew} ("statue")
          {ghew vIHo'} ("I admire the bug.") [[}=.}]]
          {Hew vIHo'} ("I admire the statue.") [[}:=.}]]

     {ghIch} ("nose")/{HIch} ("pistol, handgun")
          {ghIchDaj yIQotlh!} ("Disable his/her nose!")

               handgun!")

     {ghob} ("wage war")/{Hob} ("yawn")
          {ghob tlhIngan SuvwI'pu'.} ("Klingon
               warriors wage war.")
          {Hob tlhIngan SuvwI'pu'.} ("Klingon warriors
               yawn.") [[p.193]]

     {gho'} ("step on")/{Ho'} ("admire")
          {ghew vIgho'.} ("I step on the bug.")
          {ghew vIHo'.} ("I admire the bug.")

     {qagh} ("<gagh,> serpent worm" [food])/{qaH} ("sir")
          {lu', qagh!} ("Yes, serpent worm!")
          {lu', qaH!} ("Yes, sir!")

Mispronouncing {qaH} as {qagh} has often led to particu-
larly unfortunate results.

     {Qagh} ("err, make a mistake")/{QaH} ("help")
          {Qagh yaS wa'DIch.} ("The first officer errs.")
          {QaH yaS wa'DIch.} ("The first officer helps.")

     {regh} ("bleed")/{reH} ("play")
          {regh puqpu'.} ("The children bleed.")
          {reH puqpu'.} ("The children play.")

     {'ugh} ("be heavy")/{'uH} ("have a hangover")
          {'ugh SuvwI' qan.} ("The old warrior is
               heavy.")
          {'uH SuvwI' qan.} ("The old warrior has a
               hangover.")


{H}/{Q}

     {HIv} ("attack")/{QIv} ("be inferior")
          {HIv SuvwI'pu'.} ("The warriors attack.")
          {QIv SuvwI'pu'.} ("The warriors are inferior.")

     {Hoj} ("be cautious")/{Qoj} ("make war")
          {yIHoj!} ("Be cautious!")
          {yIQoj!} ("Make war!")

     {Huch} ("money")/{Quch} ("forehead")
          {Huch DaHutlh.} ("You lack money.")
          {Quch DaHutlh.} ("You lack a forehead.")

The remark "You lack a forehead" would be considered
extremely offensive to a Klingon, calling into question [[p.194]]
his or her very identity. Since there are any number of
phrases involving money that could be taken the wrong
way if {Huch} is pronounced {Quch}, many tourists follow
the Klingon practice of using the term {DarSeqmey}
("<darseks>"), the plural form of {DarSeq} (<"darsek">, a Klin- [[">,:=,">]]
gon unit of currency) to refer to money in general. Thus,
"You lack money" would be {DarSeqmey DaHutlh} (liter-
ally, "You lack <darseks>").

     {taH} ("continue, endure, survive")/{taQ} ("be
          weird")
          {taH tlhIngan wo'.} ("The Klingon empire
               survives.")
          {taQ tlhIngan wo'.} ("The Klingon empire is
               weird.")

There is a story, perhaps apocryphal, of a non-Klingon
actor who attempted to play the lead in the original Klin-
gon version of Shakespeare's <Hamlet> but was shouted off
the stage when he began the famous soliloquy by saying,
{taQ pagh taQbe'} ("To be weird or not to be weird"),
rather than the correct {taH pagh taHbe'} ("To be or not
to be"; literally, "[one] continues or [one] does not con-
tinue").

     {veH} ("boundary, border")/{veQ} ("garbage")
          {jogh veH lungIv.} ("They patrol the quadrant
               border.")
          {jogh veQ lungIv.} ("They patrol the quadrant
               garbage.")

     {'IH} ("be beautiful")/{'IQ} ("be sad")
          {'IH be'nallI'.} ("Your wife is beautiful.")
          {'IQ be'nallI'.} ("Your wife is sad.")


Glottal Stop: {'}

     Many nonnative speakers of Klingon, especially
those for whom Federation Standard is a first language, [[p.195]]
{{

[[image]]

<Elliott Marks>

}}
seem to have trouble with {',} the glottal stop, at the end of
a word. Articulated correctly, {'} is simply a very abrupt
cessation of vocalization. The most common mispronun-
ciation of {'} is as {q}, though some newer speakers leave {'}
off altogether. Errors of this type could lead to confusion
or confrontation.

     {ro} ("torso")/{ro'} ("fist")
          {rolIj HI'ang!} ("Show me your torso!")
          {ro'lIj HI'ang!} ("Show me your fist!")

"Show me your fist" is an idiomatic expression used to
challenge someone to take action in a manner consistent
with something he or she has just said. Substituting
"torso" for "fist" by mispronouncing {ro'} as {ro} would pro-
duce a phrase that would be interpreted only literally. Or-
dering a Klingon to reveal his or her torso is probably not
a good idea. [[p.196]]

     {paw} ("arrive")/{paw'} ("collide")
          {paw Dujmey.} ("The ships arrive.")
          {paw' Dujmey.} ("The ships collide.")

     {Suy} ("merchant")/{Suy'} ("<shooy,>" a type of
          animal)
          {Suy SoH.} ("You are a merchant.")
          {Suy' SoH.} ("You are a <shooy>.")

Calling someone a {Suy'} is quite derogatory, comparable
to using the word "pig" in Federation Standard. Mistak-
enly calling someone a {Suy} ("merchant") when the intent
is to be insulting and call him or her a {Suy'} will have the
effect of making the speaker appear to be foolish and,
therefore, weak and hardly in a position to be ridiculing
someone else. Furthermore, the speaker may inadver-
tently offend a nearby merchant.

     {HI'} ("dictator")/{HIq} ("liquor")
          {romuluS HI' vImuS.} ("I detest the Romulan
               dictator.")
          {romuluS HIq vImuS.} ("I detest Romulan
               ale.")

     {pu'} ("phaser")/{puq} ("child, offspring")
          {reH pu' vIqem.} ("I always bring a phaser.")
          {reH puq vIqem.} ("I always bring a child.")

     {lu'} ("Yes, I will")/{luq} ("Yes, I will")/{lu} ("fall [from
          power]")
          {lu' joHwI'.} ("Yes, my Lord.")
          {luq joHwI'.} ("Yes, my Lord.")
          {lu joHwI'.} ("My Lord falls from power.")

Because there are two forms of the word meaning "Yes, I
will"---{lu'} and {luq}---no confusion can result from mis-
pronouncing {'} as {q}. On the other hand, if {'} is left off en-
tirely and the word is pronounced {lu}, it may be taken to
be the verb {lu,} meaning "fall (from power)," a status one [[p.197]]
probably does not want to attribute to someone in a posi-
tion to give orders or grant requests.


DIRECT ADDRESS

     When addressing someone directly---that is---when
speaking to that person---it is sometimes appropriate to
refer to him or her by name, title, or other term of re-
spect. For example, if the president of the United Federa-
tion of Planets happens to be a human named Joseph
Smith, he may be addressed as <Mr. Smith>, <Mr. President>,
<President Smith>, or <sir>. His friends are more likely to call
him <Joseph> or <Joe>. Members of his family may refer to
him by any number of terms: <Uncle Joe>, <Dad> (or <Father>
or <Daddy>), <Grandfather> (or <Grandpa> or <Granddad>), and so
on. Finally, his closest associates, including anyone with
whom he may be romantically involved, may use special
nicknames, perhaps <Joey>, or even pet names (<sweetheart>
and the like).
     A similar range of terms of address exists among
Klingons. It is crucial that the right terms be used in the
right contexts, however. To call a Klingon by an inappro-
priate name or title is to dishonor him or her and is never
tolerated. The correct choice is based on a number of
factors such as the gender of the speaker and addressee,
the official position of either participant, and the degree
of intimacy the two share.
     It is always proper to call somebody by his or her
name alone: {Qugh}, {ghawran}, {lurSa'}, {be'etor}, {qeng}, {vIq-
SIS}, and so on. (In Federation Standard, these names are
usually rendered as Kruge, Gowron, Lursa, B'Etor, Kang,
and Vixis, respectively.) During formal occasions, it is
also not uncommon to refer to someone by his or her
father's name, such as {mogh puqloD} ("son of Mogh") or
a combination of given name plus father's name, such as
{HuS 'atrom puqbe'} ("Huss, daughter of A'trom").
     If someone has an official title, such as a military [[p.198]]
rank or a position in the government, this title follows
the name; for example, {martaq Sa'} ("General Martok"),
{ghawran Qang} ("Chancellor Gowron"). When address-
ing such a person, the title is left off only when the occa-
sion is decidedly nonofficial. As was discussed earlier
(see the chapter on The Fiction of Klingon Conformity,
under "Societal Variation," pages 36--43), the head of a [[>>link]]
house is afforded the title {joH} ("Lord, Lady"), which,
when one is addressing such a personage, may be used
either after the name (as in {qamor joH} ["Lord
Kahmor"]) or without the name if followed by the posses-
sive suffix {-wI'} ("my"), as in {joHwI'} ("my Lord, my
Lady"). In those situations in which a lower-ranked
speaker addresses a higher-ranked person (regardless of
the basis of the ranking system), a term or phrase of di-
rect address is, if not required, certainly expected. For
example, a lower-ranking member of a military unit ad-
dresses a superior by name plus rank (such as {tlha'a
HoD} ["Captain Klaa"]), by rank alone (e.g., {HoD} ["cap-
tain"]), or, as an alternative, by saying {qaH} ("sir"). The
word {qaH} is interesting because it is never heard except
in direct address. Thus, while one might say {yoH qor
HoD} ("Captain Kor is brave") or {yoH HoD} ("The captain
is brave"), one would never say {yoH qaH} ("Sir is brave.")
          In addition to names (which, as noted above, are al-
ways appropriate to use), there are a few common words
friends or family members employ when speaking to one
another. Within the family, a child usually addresses his
or her mother as {SoS} ("Mother" and father as {vav} ("Fa- [[("Mother":=("Mother")]]
ther"), though it is not uncommon for younger children
to use the words {SoSoy} ("Mommy") and {vavoy}
("Daddy"). These are the regular words for "mother" and
"father" followed by the suffix {-oy,} which indicates en-
dearment. Most older children drop the {-oy} around the
time of their Age of Ascension, though some continue to
use it even after that, especially when addressing the par-
ent of the opposite sex. By the same token, a parent may [[p.199]]
address a son as {puqloDoy} ({puqloD,} "son," plus {-oy}) and
a daughter as {puqbe'oy} ({puqbe',} "daughter," plus {-oy}).
As with the terms for parents, the {-oy} form is seldom
used past the child's Age of Ascension. Though almost
always heard as terms of direct address (as in {SoSoy
jIghung} ["Mommy, I'm hungry"]), kinship terms with the
suffix {-oy} are occasionally used as subjects or objects of
sentences, particularly in the speech of younger children.
For example, a proud child may say, {SuvwI' ghaH vav-
oy'e'} ("My daddy is a warrior").
     The word for "husband" is {loDnal} and that for "wife"
is {be'nal}. Though there are occasional exceptions, for the
most part, neither of these words is used in direct ad-
dress (in a sentence such as {loDnal HIghoS} ["Husband,
come here"]) and neither of them typically takes the suf-
fix of endearment {-oy} (as in {be'naloy} ["wifey"]). A similar
pattern is observed for {parmaqqay}, which means "some-
one involved in a romantic relationship with a specific
other person" ("romantic partner," perhaps). The word
{parmaqqay} is formed from {parmaq}, conventionally
translated "love" or "romance" (though the Klingon con-
cept is far more aggressive than the Federation Standard
translations imply), plus {qay}, an otherwise unknown ele-
ment. One may refer to one's "romantic partner" as
{parmaqqaywI'} ("my {parmaqqay}"), but one rarely uses
the word in direct address (as in, say, {parmaqqay HI-
ghoS} ["{parmaqqay}, come here"]). Instead, couples (of-
ficially married and otherwise) tend to call each other by
pet names (sometimes called endearments or hypoco-
risms or, in Klingon, {bang pongmey} ["beloveds'
names"]). A {bang pong} (the singular form, "beloved's
name") is usually couple-specific---that is, the set of ex-
pressions used by one couple is different from that used
by another couple. Pet names are almost never uttered
unless the two members of the couple are alone and,
therefore, are seldom known by anyone else. Indeed, one
of the defining characteristics of a {bang pong} is that it [[p.200]]
{{

[[image]]

Jadzia is not the {parmaqqay} that Worf expects. <Danny Feld>

}}
be secret, known only by the two members of the couple.
The phenomenon of the {bang pong}, however, is not se-
cret. Usually, parents teach their children how the system
works and have to give examples in doing so, though it is
not known whether the example pet names are actual pet
names used by the parents doing the teaching. Some-
times, however, children learn about the custom from
other children. In particular, younger children often tell
each other pet names they have heard. A child who has a
reputation for revealing pet names is usually quite popu-
lar among other children, though older Klingons, upon
finding out about his or her lack of propriety, will cer-
tainly take disciplinary action. As children grow older
and start to experience {parmaq} ("love, romance") them-
selves, they tend to become quite protective of their own
{bang pongmey}.
     Primarily because of the conversations of children, [[p.201]]
but also because, despite all precautions, one member of
a couple is on rare occasion overheard saying a {bang
pong}, it is possible to give a small number of examples.
A {bang pong} is formed by attaching {-oy}, the suffix indi-
cating endearment, to an everyday noun. Most of the re-
sulting terms make very little sense to anyone not in the
particular relationship, and none translates well. Some
pet terms are based on words for kinds of food, such as
{chatlhoy} (from {chatlh} ["soup"]) and {'awje'oy} (from
{'awje'} ["root beer"]). Perhaps these words could be ren-
dered in Federation Standard as "soupy" and "poppy"
(from "soda pop"), though neither translation conveys
the intimacy and intensity of the Klingon. Other terms
consist of words for weapons plus {-oy}; for example:
{yanoy} ({yan,} "sword"), {HIchoy} ({HIch,} "pistol"), {tajoy}
({taj,} "knife"), {jorwI'oy} ({jorwI',} "explosive"). A third type
involves body parts, Klingon or otherwise, as in {'uSoy}
({'uS,} "leg"), {'aDoy} ({'aD,} "vein"), {pIpoy} ({pIp,} "spine"),
{pachoy} ({pach,} "claw"). Another term based on a body
part, {Ho'oy} (from {Ho'} ["tooth"]), is one of the few that
makes sense to a non-Klingon if it is remembered that
{Ho'} is a slang term for "hero, idol." (It is also enormously
important that this word be pronounced correctly so that
it is not misconstrued as {Ho''oy'} ["toothache"]).
     Because of the nature of the {parmaq} relationship,
misusing a {bang pong} is a serious cultural offense. This
could mean, among other things, revealing a {bang pong}
to someone other than one's {parmaqqay}, revealing a
third party's {bang pong} (regardless of how this informa-
tion was acquired), addressing one's {parmaqqay} by the
wrong pet name, or using a {bang pong} in a public set-
ting. Unless a visitor gets involved in a serious relation-
ship with a Klingon, it is strongly advised that one avoid
saying anything that can be misinterpreted as a misused
{bang pong}.
     For terms of address among friends outside of a fam-
ily or romantic relationship, there are a number of op- [[p.202]]
tions, and a number of rules governing their use. The
normal word for "friend" is {jup} and it may be used in
direct address in sentences such as {jup 'Iw HIq yItlhutlh}
("Friend, drink the bloodwine"). It commonly occurs
with the possessive suffix {-wI'} ("my"): {jupwI' 'Iw HIq
yItlhutlh} ("My friend, drink the bloodwine"). The word
{jup}, however, does not necessarily connote a close
friend. For this, one may add the noun suffix {-na'} ("defi-
nite") to the word and say {jupna'} ("real friend, good
friend"): {jupna' 'Iw HIq yItlhutlh} ("Good friend, drink
the bloodwine") or {jupna'wI' 'Iw HIq yItlhutlh} ("My
good friend, drink the bloodwine"). In addition, however,
there are some other terms used for very close friends,
and the correct usage depends, among other things, on
the gender of the speaker and the addressee.
     The word {maqoch}, sometimes translated as "buddy"
or "pal," is used most often by a male addressing another
male who is a good friend, as in {maqoch 'Iw HIq yI-
tlhutlh} ("Pal, drink the bloodwine"). When used in such
a context, it signifies genuine companionship. If, how-
ever, it is used by someone who is definitely not a good
friend, such as a member of a house with which one has
been feuding, it is considered offensive. Furthermore, if
used by a casual acquaintance, it may be taken as a sign
of aggression; Klingons are generally apprehensive about
those showing too much friendship. A Klingon female
would address someone as {maqoch} only if she intended
to insult him or her. A Klingon male with any honor at
all would never address a female as {maqoch}. The word
{maqoch} itself may derive from {may' qoch} (literally,
"battle partner"), so perhaps it originally meant some-
thing like "war buddy."
     There is a word that Klingon females use in a pattern
paralleling the males' use of {maqoch}. This word is {chaj},
a close female friend of a female. As with {maqoch}, it is
used only in addressing a true friend. If uttered by a fe- [[p.203]]
{{

[[image]]

have shared many battles. <Robbie Robinson>

}}
male adversary, it is insulting; if uttered by a casual ac-
quaintance it is presumptuous. A male Klingon would
address a female Klingon as {chaj} only to offend her. If a
male were to be addressed as {chaj}, by either a male or a
female, he would consider his honor to be attacked and
would react accordingly.
     It is not uncommon for a Klingon father to address
his son as {maqoch} or for a Klingon mother to address
her daughter as {chaj}. The reverse, however, is not true.
That is, a son would never call his father {maqoch,} nor
would a daughter address her mother as {chaj}.
     Because of the dangers inherent in using {maqoch}
and {chaj} inappropriately, it is suggested that visitors be
quite sure of the status of their relationships with indi-
vidual Klingons before uttering or reacting to either of
these words. [[p.204]]

MISMATCHED CONCEPTS

     When translating from one language to another,
some concepts are easily conveyed. For example, the
Klingon word {mIn} means the same thing as its usual
Federation Standard translation---<eye>, {Hov} refers to the
same celestial object as <star>, and either {cha'pujqutmey}
or <dilithium crystals> will work in a warp drive system. On
the other hand, some concepts do not translate easily at
all. Thus, Federation Standard has no word meaning the
same as Klingon {tova'Daq}, a sort of mind sharing or in-
sight into one another's thoughts; Klingon has no word
corresponding exactly to the Federation Standard <hypo-
chondria>. In order to avoid unfortunate misunderstand-
ings, it is essential that a traveler to a Klingon planet be
aware of instances in which Klingon and his or her native
language do not quite match up. [[p.205]]
     The differences between cultures plays a critical role
here. Some words lack direct equivalents simply because
they refer to concepts embedded in one culture but not
the other. Thus, though conventional translations exist,
there are not really one-for-one matches for various
weapons, food-preparation implements, and so on. Klin-
gon has at least two words, {maHpIn} and {Duq}, corre-
sponding to Federation Standard <bowl>, but no single
word to refer to both; Federation Standard lacks distinc-
tive vocabulary for the two vessels, so it must add on ad-
jectives or descriptive phrases: <large bowl for serving>,
<small bowl for eating from>.
     There are various other ways of dealing with con-
cepts that do not have direct equivalents. For example,
one language may borrow (and, in the process, phoneti-
cally modify) a word for a concept is lacks, such as Feder- [[is:=it]]
ation Standard <bat'leth> for the Klingon weapon {betleH},
or Klingon {qa'vIn} ("coffee"), which seems to be taken
from Federation Standard <caffeine>. A similar technique
is to not incorporate the word of one language into the
other, but to simply use the foreign word itself, pronoun-
cing it with greater or lesser accuracy, depending on the
linguistic skill of the speaker. For instance, the {jInaq}, an
amulet given to a Klingon girl to symbolize her coming
of age, may be pronounced correctly or else "Federation-
ized" to sound something like "gin knack," but there is no
word <jinak> or the like in Federation Standard. A third
approach is for one language to translate the item in
question, such as Federation Standard <painstik>, which is
a pretty exact translation of Klingon {'oy'naQ} ({'oy',}
"pain"; {naQ,} "cane, staff").
     Often, when no exact equivalent is available, a near
equivalent is used. For example, as noted earlier (see the
chapter on Argot: Specialized Vocabulary, under the sec-
tion on "Food," pages 83--103), the Klingon verb {vut} is [[>>link]]
conventionally translated "cook," but heat is seldom in-
volved in the activity. Similarly, the Klingon words {jaj}, [[p.206]]
{jar}, and {DIS} are normally translated as "day," "month,"
and "year," respectively, but the length of a Klingon day,
month, or year is not the same as the Terran counterpart.
Calculating the length of a Klingon day, month, or year
is not at all a straightforward exercise, but suffice it to
say that a period of five months is not the same amount
of time as a period of {vagh jarmey} ({vagh,} "five"; {-mey,}
plural indicator).
     Even if cultural differences are not involved, or at
least not involved in any obvious way, terms may be lack-
ing in one language or the other. For example, in both
Klingon and Federation Standard, there is a verb for
"consume solid food" (<eat>, {Sop}) and another for "con-
sume liquid" (<drink>, {tlhutlh}). In Klingon, but not in Fed-
eration Standard, there is a third verb in this set, {'ep},
which refers to consuming soup or, more accurately, to
consuming Klingon {chatlh}, which contains less liquid
than the typical Terran <soup>. (It should be noted that al-
though the Federation Standard verb <slurp> may well
apply to how a Klingon consumes {chatlh}, it is not an
accurate translation of {'ep,} since it refers to eating and
drinking noisily, not to the consumption of soup in par-
ticular.)
     It is also quite common for a language to not make a
terminological distinction in the same way the another [[the another:=another]]
does. Thus, Federation Standard uses the single word <day>
to refer to both a period of 24 Earth hours (generally
reckoned from midnight to midnight) and to that part of
the 24-hour period which is light (<day> as opposed to
<night>). In Klingon, there are two distinct terms: {jaj} is the
period from dawn to dawn; {pem} is that part of a {jaj}
which is light (as opposed to {ram} ["night"]). Although
Federation Standard also makes use of the locutions <day-
time> and <nighttime>, when a speaker of Federation Stan-
dard is counting periods of daytime, only <day> is used.
Thus, <three days>, with no further context, is ambiguous,
for it can refer to three 24-hour periods (as in "They wan- [[p.207]]
dered for three days") or three periods of daylight (as in
"They wandered for three days and three nights"). In
Klingon, {wej jajmey} ({wej,} "three"; {-mey,} plural indica-
tor) means only three stretches from dawn to dawn; {wej
pemmey} means "three periods of daylight" (as opposed
to {wej rammey} ["three nights"]).
     Finally, there are some words that simply do not
translate. One must resort to descriptions rather than
simple one- or two-word translations, and one must be
a quite facile in the language and knowledgeable of the
culture to understand the concepts. The Klingon notion
of sharing of minds noted above, {tova'Daq}, is an exam-
ple of such a word. So is {parmaq}, the Klingon term for
an aggressive sort of romantic feeling. Sometimes seem-
ingly ordinary concepts cannot be expressed easily. For
example, the Klingon verb {mI'} may be translated
"dance," but it also means "exercise, do calisthenics, do
martial arts movements." The central idea of {mI'} is that
a physical activity is performed that results in no change,
other than, perhaps, in the well-being of the person per-
forming the action. Thus, it is wrong to use {mI'} for "run
to a place," though it is quite appropriate to use it for
"run in place." No term in Federation Standard means
quite the same thing as Klingon {mI'}. By the same token,
no word in Klingon means quite the same thing as Feder-
ation Standard <dance>. At many Klingon festivals, a popu-
lar group of performers is called the {qul mI'wI'pu',}
usually translated as "fire dancers" ({qul,} "fire"; {mI'wI',}
"dancer, exerciser"; {-pu',} plural indicator). Since what
the performer is doing is properly designated by the verb
{mI'} but not really accurately described by the translation
<dance>, the visitor---particularly one who learned the Klin-
gon word only by its usual Federation Standard transla-
tion---is in for quite a surprise when the show begins. [[p.208]]

ADDENDUM TO THE
DICTIONARY

The following vocabulary lists are intended to sup-
plement the original <Klingon Dictionary> published
some years ago. They contain a number of words verified
after the compilation of that book as well as words dis-
cussed and exemplified in earlier chapters of this volume.
Though the Federation's knowledge of Klingon vocabu-
lary is certainly increasing, it must be emphasized that
there is still a great deal of information about Klingon
that is not yet documented or well understood. Thus, the
lists, even when joined with those in the <Dictionary,> must
still be considered incomplete.
     There are two parts to this dictionary addendum: one
with words arranged alphabetically by Klingon, the other
with words arranged alphabetically by Federation Stan-
dard. The abbreviations, notational conventions, and
Klingon alphabetical ordering system used in the origi-
nal <Dictionary> are retained here. Words regarded as slang
are so marked, as are words found in certain regions but
not used throughout the Empire. In some cases, words
listed here are also in the original <Dictionary> to provide
clarification or to illustrate a broader range of meanings
than was originally known. [[p.210]]

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

MARC OKRAND devised the dialogue and coached the actors speaking
the Klingon[TM] language heard in <Star TrekÂ® III: The Search for Spock>[TM],
<Star Trek V: The Final Frontier>[TM], and <Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered
Country>[TM]. The Klingon language he developed has also been used in a
number of episodes of <Star Trek: The Next Generation>Â®, <Star Trek: Deep
Space Nine>Â®, and <Star Trek: Voyager>[TM]. In addition, he created the Vulcan
dialogue for <Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan>, as well as <Star Trek III>. [[III:=III: The Search for Spock]]

He is the author of <The Klingon Dictionary> (Pocket Books, 1985; revised
edition, 1992), an introduction to the grammar and vocabulary of the
language, and <The Klingon Way: A Warrior's Guide> (Pocket Books, 1996), an
annotated compilation of Klingon proverbs. He can be heard describing
various aspects of the language and its effective use on the
audiocassettes <Conversational Klingon> (Simon & Schuster Audioworks, [[audiocassettes:=audio cassettes]]
1992) and <Power Klingon> (cowritten with Barry Levine, Simon &
Schuster Audioworks, 1993), both narrated by Michael Dorn. He also
devised Klingon dialogue and contributed to the language lab portion
of the CD-ROM <Star Trek: Klingon> (Simon & Schuster Interactive, 1996).

He has degrees in linguistics from the Santa Cruz and Berkeley
campuses of the University of California and has conducted linguistic
research as a postdoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington, D.C. In addition to his work on Klingon, he has written
articles on linguistics for several journals and anthologies. [[p.back cover]]

STAR TREKÂ®
KLINGON[TM]
FOR THE
GALACTIC TRAVELER

{"Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam"}
"It is a good day to die."

What is the proper response to this?
What should I do?

Now, with
KLINGON FOR THE GALACTIC TRAVELER
you will know.

Organized into four easy-to-use sections, this book will guide your steps
through the Klingon language and customs:
Â· The regional dialects of the Empire
Â· Common, everyday usage of the language
Â· The slang phrases and curses that color the Klingon vocabulary
Â· Most importantly, the proper verbal, physical, and cultural responses.

A misspoken word to a Klingon, who is quick to take offense and even
quicker to take action, could have dire consequences. This book is the
indispensable guide for the galactic traveler.
