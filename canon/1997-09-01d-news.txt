Thanks for the nice words about the new book.  I'm impressed that some of
the new vocabulary there is already incorporated into these postings.

SuStel charghwI' je -- muquvmoH QInmey DalI'pu'bogh tlhIH.

As for how to use <Sum> "be near, nearby" -- that will require some more
time with Maltz.

Do' Sum matlh.

I would think, however, that it would work the same way as <Hop> "be far."

I'll see what Maltz has to say.
