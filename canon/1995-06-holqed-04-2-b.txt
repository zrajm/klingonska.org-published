{chuvmey}

We don't have a lot of information about Klingon imports (other than
the occasional case of Romulan ale and the still mysterious substances
{qevaS} and {DIlyum}). But it seems likely that they must import coffee. A
recently located short note from an interview with Maltz reveals the Klingon
word for coffee:

{qa'vIn}

     Okrand acknowledges that it is unclear whether this obvious cognate
refers to the beverage itself, or to the prominence of "caffeine" in the brew,
or perhaps to both at once.
