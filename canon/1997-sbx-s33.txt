  Type: trading card
  Date: 1997
  Title: {So'wI'} <Cloaking Device> (SkyBox S33)
  Author: Marc Okrand (translation)
  Publisher: SkyBox International Inc.
  Summary: This is the third of the three <Star Trek: The Next Generation>
    sixth season trading cards. Notice especially that not all of the Klingon
    text is translated on the card. (The text of this card, except for the
    small print, was also reproduced in <{HolQeD} 6:2>, p.9, but the word
    {puvtaHbogh} was there mistakenly given as {puVlaHbogh} and the word
    {Suqpu'} wrongly given as {Soqpu'}.)
  Credit: Nancy Nielsen-Brown gave me this card at the {qep'a' SochDIch}.

  : [From SkyBox trading card S33, 1996 (TNG 6th season). The text of
  : this card was also reprinted in HQ6:2 p.9. In the HolQeD reprint the
  : word {puvtaHbogh} is misspelled {puVlaHbogh}, and the word {Suqpu'}
  : incorrecly spelled {Soqpu'}.

  : On the SkyBox card the words {Duj ngabmoHlaw'} are incorrectly
  : written {DujngabmoHlaw'} as one word, the period preceeding the
  : sentence {chaq tampu'.} is not followed by a space, and the word
  : {romuluSnganpu'vaD} is incorrectly spelled {romulu Snganpu'vaD} as
  : two words (these errors are retained above).]

  : From Steven Boozer's notes:
  : There were a few typos in the version published in HolQeD 6.2 due to the
  : artistic font used on the cards but ghunchu'wI' has verified the text.
  : The card reads HovpoH Hut vagh cha' wa' vI' jav but it seems likely
  : Okrand's eye slipped a line when looking up "mark" in the Addendum:
  :        mark (in coordinates) (n)               DoD
  :        marksmanship, sharpshooting (n)         vI'
  : They are listed right next to each other (TKD, p. 189).]

Cloaking Device
So'wI'

All Klingon vessels are equipped with a cloaking device, allowing the ship to fly in a
state of practical invisibility. Cloaking technology was gained through an alliance with
the Romulan Star Empire, possibly in exchange for Warp Drive technology. Due to the
tremendous energy drain of a cloaking device, weapons cannot be discharged while the
cloak is in operation.
