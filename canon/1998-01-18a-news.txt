Subject: The Klingon language and this forum


Hello to everyone.

After coping with some fascinating (for some) computer problems and then
working out the switch from the old MSN Klingon language forum to this new
newsgroup, I am finally up and running.

I've read the messages about whether discussions on the Klingon language
should be in this newsgroup or in a separate one.  I'll let that issue
resolve itself as time goes along.   For now, I hope to hear not only from
Klingon language experts (and there are many out there who can claim that
title), but also from those who are just curious about how the language
works, how it came about or how it's changed, what Worf (or Gowron or Dax
or even Kruge or Chang, for that matter) is really saying though sometimes
this requires a bit of study, especially when they're speaking colloquially [[especially:=(especially]]
or using ritualistic speech), and so on.

I'll try to check in every week or so and answer any questions I can.
(Questions involving fine -- or even not so fine -- points of grammar
usually don't lend themselves to quick responses, however, so have a little
patience there.)

Qapla'!
