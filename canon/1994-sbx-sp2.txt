The Klingon battle knife is designed primarily for
versatility of use, so that the user is never caught
at a disadvantage. Two small, secondary blades
eject from the knife's sides, providing both a hand
guard and another set of cutting edges. A brutally
spiked pommel fastens the hilt together to provide
a damaging surprise attack or give a devastating
backhand stroke.
