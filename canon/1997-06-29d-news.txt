Regarding "tonight" and so forth, I'd go along with your suggestion:

DaHjaj ram "tonight" (literally "today night" or "today's night")

DaHjaj po "this morning" (literally "today morning" or "today's morning")

DaHjaj pov "this afternoon" (literally "today afternoon" or "today's
afternoon")

DaHjaj DungluQ "this noon" (literally "today noon" or "today's noon") 

DaHjaj ramjep "this midnight" (literally "today midnight" or "today's
midnight")

DaHjaj pemjep "this midday" (literally "today midday" or "today's midday") 

(The phrases "this noon," "this midnight," and "this midday" are a little
awkward in English -- we'd probably say "today at noon," "tonight at
midnight," "today in the middle of the day" or something -- but in Klingon,
they fall right into place.)

In Klingon, you could even say DaHjaj pem "today's daytime," which would
probably be typically contrasted with DaHjaj ram "today's night" (or
"tonight").

wa'leS po "tomorrow morning," cha'leS po "the morning of the day after
tomorrow" (literally "two-days-from-now morning"), and so on work quite
nicely.

Adding -vam "this" to most words designating fixed periods of time seems to
be the only way to indicate "current."  Thus the current year or "this
year" is DISvam (referring, of course, to a Klingon year, or DIS), the
current month or "this month" is jarvam (jar "[Klingon] month"), and the
current week or "this week" is Hoghvam (Hogh "[Klingon] week").  There
don't seem to be special words for "the current year" and so forth
comparable to DaHjaj "the current day" or "today."  DaHjaj seems to be
formed of the adverbial DaH "now" plus the noun jaj "day," a unique type of
formation as far as I know.  It is perhaps by analogy to DISvam, jarvam,
etc. -- all formed by simply adding a noun suffix to a noun -- that
Klingons also refer to the current day as jajvam "this day" (jaj "day,
period from dawn to dawn").

Though they both can be translated "today," DaHjaj and jajvam are not quite
interchangeable.  As the time element in a sentence, DaHjaj (and not
jajvam) is used:

	DaHjaj romuluSngan vIHoHpu' "today I killed a Romulan"
	(DaHjaj "today," romuluSngan "Romulan," vIHoHpu' "I have killed 
	him/her")

As the subject of a sentence, on the other hand, jajvam is more typically
found:

	nI' jajvam "this day is long"
	(nI' "[it] is long [in duration], jajvam "this day")

though DaHjaj is not impossible:

	nI' DaHjaj "today is long"
	(nI' "[it] is long [in duration], DaHjaj "today")

DaHjaj also behaves as a noun (as opposed to an adverbial element) in such
noun-noun constructions as  DaHjaj gheD "today prey" or "today's prey," a
term often heard in Klingon restaurants with a meaning comparable to "catch
of the day."

Phrases such as jajvam po "this day morning" or "this morning" are not
common, but they're not ungrammatical either.
