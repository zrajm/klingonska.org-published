Painstik
'oy'naQ

The Klingon Painstik is an important part of a Klingon's Age of Ascension ceremony. The Painstik is employed by friends
of the recipient who use the devices to inflict pain in a manner which will allow the Klingon to attain a higher state of
spirituality as a warrior, proving his mettle. Painstiks are a little over one meter long and emit a highly-charged shock
for the express purpose of inflicting pain.
