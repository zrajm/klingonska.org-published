As far as I know, {'ej} means "and" in the sense of "in addition," "also,"
"as well as," and the like.  It does not have any temporal or sequential
implications.  That is, it does not (by itself) mean "and then." 

For example, Klingon {jISop 'ej jItlhutlh} "I eat and I drink" ({jI-} "I,"
{Sop} "eat,"  {tlhutlh} "drink") means "I eat and also I drink."  It could
refer to events that occur in alternating fashion (eat some, drink some,
eat some, drink some more) or, especially in the case of some Klingons,
events that occur pretty much simultaneously.  It could also mean "I eat
and then I drink," but it does not necessarily mean that.  If that is the
intended meaning (and if being a little vague or ambiguous or unclear will
cause misunderstanding and hence discomfort), additional stuff must be
added or the whole thing must be rephrased to make the meaning explicit
(such as {jItlhutlhpa' jISop} "before I drink, I eat" [{-pa'} "before"]). 

Similarly, the most likely interpretation of {jItlhutlh 'ej jIQong} "I
drink and I sleep" ({Qong} "sleep") is not that I drink in my sleep
(though it could be used for that if I really did it), but rather simply
"I drink and also I sleep," a listing of two things I do, presumably (but
not explicitly) not at the same time. 

Then there's {qaDuQ 'ej bIregh} "I stab you and you bleed"  ({qa-} "I [do
something to] you," {DuQ} "stab," {bI-} "you," {regh} "bleed").  It
probably would be used when the stabbing precedes (and is the direct cause
of) the bleeding.  But it doesn't explicitly say that; it only says "I
stab you" and it also says "you bleed."  The sequential interpretation
(and/or the cause-and-effect interpretation)  is due to the way the world
works.  Or some worlds. 

Since it is possible to say either {jISop, jItlhutlh} "I eat, I drink" or
{jISop 'ej jItlhutlh} "I eat and I drink"  to refer to the same thing, it
might seem as though {'ej} is optional.  Grammatically, that's fair to
say.  In terms of meaning, however, when {'ej} is used, it adds something; 
it emphasizes or points out some sort of connection between the two events
-- though not necessarily a temporal one. 

Finally, although I've been referring to "events," the same holds for
states and conditions and the like.  Thus, {jIghung 'ej jIQeH} "I'm hungry
and I'm angry" ({ghung} "be hungry," {QeH} "be angry") could be used if
first I'm hungry and then (whether as a result of the pangs or not) I get
angry, or if I'm hungry and angry at the same time, or if I waver between
the two. 

In short, {'ej} is neutral as to time.
