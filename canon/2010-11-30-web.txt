kli list server down?

I haven't received any mails from tlhingan-hol@kliorg since november 22nd, I have sent a few, but apparently they didn't arrive. When you search the database [http://www.kli.org/tlhIngan-Hol/2010/November/] you see the last message of that date.
I am posting this here, becaue I hope that somebody might explain what's happening, or maybe tell the correct person to fix it.

I've got news from Maltz, and I would like to post it at the appropriate place ;-)

Lieven L. Litaer What do you think is the most wanted word?

B.J. Felix Malmenbeck Interesting question; it's something I've thought about often, but now that you ask I have a hard time coming up with anything. However, I've long wanted words for "the future", "the past" and "to be infinite".

Lieven L. Litaer I know that many people used to have trouble using a "stone panel" for pictures and the like.

Lieven L. Litaer Finally, someone last year asked for the word for "picture." At first, Maltz wondered why nagh beQ wasn't good enough. But then he thought about it some more and said that another word, mIllogh, could be used for any sort of depiction, including drawings, photographs, cartoons, icons on 21st-century computers, and so on.

Rohan Fenwick @Felix, I have been using {ret} and {pIq} for "past" and "future", and I honestly don't think we need any better words than those.

Rohan Fenwick ...sorry Felix, premature post there. :P What I mean is as in {QaQ DaHjaj wo' 'ach qaq ret wo'} "the Empire is good these days, but it was better in the past" (i.e. "the Empire of the past was preferable"). And @Quvar, I am looking forward to hearing the "more" that you mentioned! {{:)

B.J. Felix Malmenbeck Hmm, interesting; I've never seen those words be used in that way, before.

...and I, too, look forward to the "more"; as always, Quvar, I very much appreciate your contributions to the jatlhwI' community :)

Rohan Fenwick I wonder if {mIllogh} might be because Dr Okrand has been asked for the word for "picture" MILlions of times? {mIl} + {-logh} "times"? {{:)

Lieven L. Litaer this was also my first thought. And I was really surprised, because I expected he would never "reveal" this word, just like the one for bread.

Michael Roney Jr. My first thought was "what's the pun?".

Michael Roney Jr. ((Ah, "enter" equals "post")) Of all the words to end up as mIllogh, I wonder why he chose this one.

Lieven L. Litaer Yes, enter is post.
But when you hit "Shift+Enter", you can do this:
new line.
an when you're finished, hit "enter".

Lieven L. Litaer why did you wonder why he chose that one? I also think it's that pun.

Michael Roney Jr. Well I'm sure there are lots of words that he's been asked for "millions of times". So if that's the pun, then mIllogh could've been any number of words.
Maybe it was timing.

B.J. Felix Malmenbeck Well, since the question was what the most wanted word, I'm guessing he'd decided before-hand to translate that word as mIllogh.

Lieven L. Litaer I would want to change this now in the translation part of facebook, but it doesn't let me, telling I'm too new. Does any one know how to solve that problem???

B.J. Felix Malmenbeck I used to have that problem, too, even though I've been around since before the Translation application was released, and worked on one of the first translations. It sorted itself out, in the end, but it took a good while. I suggest using the "Provide Feedback" link on the Dashboard.

Lieven L. Litaer I used that more than once. Perhaps I just need to keep trying. This is really annoying, as I have many good ides to translate into Klingon, and I just can't.
