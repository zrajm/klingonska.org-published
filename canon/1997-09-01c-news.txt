There's a bit more about all of this in the new book "Klingon For the
Galactic Traveler" (pages 184-185), but I (and what it says in the book)
agree with what Neal wrote.

It is not infrequent to hear nonnative speakers of Klingon use <nuqneH>
"what do you want?" as if it meant "hello" or the like in exchanges such
as:

 Speaker #1: nuqneH

 Speaker #2: nuqneH

No one steeped in Klingon culture would do this, however (except in some
sort of a joking context, perhaps).  To begin a conversation, just start!
Or approach someone and wait for him/her to say <nuqneH> to you.  If that
person doesn't say anything, you probably don't want to talk to him/her
anyway.
