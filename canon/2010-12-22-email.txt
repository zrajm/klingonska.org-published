Okay, now that we have agreed on what {ghIn} might mean, it's time for 
the next bit of Marc Okrand's email:

There was another question about whether {loDnI'nal} and {be'nI'nal} 
could be "brother-in-law" and "sister-in-law."  Maltz said he didn't 
think there were specific words for these concepts.  He said to just 
describe the relationship: {loDnI' loDnal} and {be'nI' loDnal} for 
"brother-in-law" and {loDnI' be'nal} and {be'nI' be'nal} for 
"sister-in-law."  He said you could even say things like {be'nal loDnI' 
be'nal} "wife's brother's wife."  But he preferred to call all these 
people {'e'nalpu'} "people who married into the family."
