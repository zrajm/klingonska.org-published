Star Trek III: The Search for Spock Special Collector's Edition DVD
===================================================================
This DVD has (among others) a special feature is called "Speaking Klingon",
described on the back cover as "Linguist Marc Okrand provides a detailed
account of the creation of Klingon language and how he created a separate
language for Vulcans." Since Okrand was involved in the project, it has been
speculated that these sentences may have been written by Okrand, but this has
not been verified. (They might therefore be canon.)

The are no English translations on the DVD cover.
