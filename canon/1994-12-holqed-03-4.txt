Everyday Klingon

In <{HolQeD}> 3:2 we presented the contents of card 99 from the <Star Trek: Deep
Space Nine,> 1993 Series, a rather lengthy piece of text composed by Marc [[Series:=series]]
Okrand for SkyBox International, Inc.  This issue we bring you the copy from
three additional cards from yet another SkyBox series, <Star Trek: The Next
Generation,> first season.  These specialty cards (labeled SP1, SP2 and SP3),
along with card 99 from the other deck, give us some unprecedented
examples of extended discourse in Klingon.

        SP 1    {Qo'noS wo'}    Empire of Kronos [[SP 1:=SP1]]

    {tlhIngan wo' Degh 'oH Deghvam'e'.  tlhIngan Dujmey law'qu'
    SommeyDaq batlh cha'lu'.  juHqo' Qo'noSvo' loghDaq
    legntaHvIS tlhInganpu' 'ej qo'mey Sar charghtaHvIS chaH Dat [[legntaHvIS:=lengtaHvIS]]
    tlhIngan may'Duj luleghDI' neH qIb nganpu' buQpu' may'Duj 'ej
    ghIpu' 'oH.  nIteb ghIpu' je Deghvam.} [[ghIpu':=ghIjpu']] [[twice]]

    This marking represents the Klingon Empire and has been
    emblazoned upon the hulls of countless Klingon Starships.  During
    the aggressive expansion of the Klingon people from their
    homeworld of Kronos into space, this symbol grew to become as
    feared throughout the galaxy as the menacing profiles of their
    battlecruisers.


        SP2    {SuvwI' taj}    Blade of the Warrior

    {lI'qu' tlhIngan may' taj.  not Hub'eghrupHa' lo'wI'.  taj
    DopmeyDaq nargh cha' tajHom.  ghop luQan tajHommey.
    pe'laH je.  moQDaq DuQwI' Hommey jej tu'lu'.  pay' HIvDI'
    lo'wI' pagh mupDI' QIHchu' bIH.}

    The Klingon battle knife is designed primarily for versatility of use,
    so that the user is never caught at a disadvantage.  Two small,
    secondary blades eject from the knife's sides, providing both a hand
    guard and another set of cutting edges.  A brutally spiked pommel
    fastens the hilt together to provide a damaging surprise attack or
    give a devastating backhand stroke.


        SP3    {tlhIngan wIy}    Klingon Tactical Display

    {'ejyo' luch rurbe'qu' tlhIngan Duj luch.  Hos law'qu' luch law'qu'
    je lo' Duj nuH pat Hub pat je.  motlh ray' luSamlaHmeH De'
    Qatlh cha' tlhIngan Duj jIH'a'.  motlh pIm 'ejyo' Dujmey.}

<[Editor's note: The use of a lowercase "s" in {Hos} above is obviously incorrect, but is
reproduced as it appeared on the card.]>

    Klingon starship design is vastly different from Starfleet technology.
    A huge amount of the ship's power and technology is devoted to its [[p.11]]
    weapons grid and defensive systems.  Unlike most Starfleet vessels,
    the main viewer on a Klingon ship is usually overlaid with a
    complex target acquisition grid.

    One additional bit of translation, appearing on all three of the cards
described above, is the following trademark, registration, and copyright
notices, a nice finishing touch.
