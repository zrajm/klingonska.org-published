[[English translation from <The Fajo Collection> rulebook.]]

SUCCESS!

When threatened, fight. When in doubt, surprise them. Brute strength is not the
most important asset in a fight. Real power is in the heart. A Klingon does not
run away from his battles.

If an opponent attacks you, during that battle your Klingons with Honor add
INTEGRITY to STRENGTH. (Not cumulative.)

Zrajm C Akfohg: Did you have anything to do with the translation of the
Decipher Inc. playing cards?

Marc Okrand (May 16, 2013): The honest and real answer is: I don't know. I
don't remember doing those cards, but I may have. I looked around to see if I
had any evidence of doing them (like a contract!), but couldn't find anything.
Which doesn't mean a thing. Sorry I can't be more definitive.
