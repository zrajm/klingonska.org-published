To all those too polite to say anything...

The Klingon sentence I wrote to SuStel and charghwI' [be sure to pronounce
his name correctly!] contains a grammatical error.  It's not a weird
dialectal variation; it has nothing to do with social status; it's not a
form of secret or disguised speech.  It's just plain wrong. 
 
The verb should be <bolI'pu'bogh>, using the prefix <bo-> "you (plural)
[do something to] it/them," not <Da-> "you (singular) [do something to]
it/them." 
 
Though plural suffixes are not obligatory on nouns (<SuvwI'> can mean
either "warrior" or "warriors"), Klingons are fussy about the verb
prefixes. 
 
Sorry for any confusion this may have caused.  Clearly, Maltz never saw my
posting.
