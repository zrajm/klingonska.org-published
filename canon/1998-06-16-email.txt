There were certainly Klingon clerics on Boreth, at the monastery that was
established by the followers of Kahless.  Whatever else they did, they
created a clone of Kahless. :-)  It seems that their duty was to await
Kahless' return, to remember and tell stories about him in the meantime,
and to guide or advise others in spiritual matters.  I have usually
thought of the particular clerics portrayed in the TNG episode "Rightful
Heir" as religious leaders/guides, which is an idea I think the Klingon
phrase {lalDan DevwI'} captures well.
