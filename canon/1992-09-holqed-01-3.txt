KLI Archives

One of the purposes of the KLI is to establish and maintain a collection of
works relating to Klingon language and culture. The following is an
excerpt from an issue of <{veS QonoS},> a newsletter published by Mortas-Te-
Kaase, dated 1990. It was supplied by Tom Scheuer who, along with Marc
Okrand, graciously provided permission for its reprinting in <{HolQeD}.> While
a few of the items below were more formally published in last year's reissue
of <TKD,> most of them will be new to you, and are a welcome addition.

    The following word list was granted permission for
    publication in <{veS QonoS}> by the {HolloD} on 490/3.18
    (Copyright 1990 Marc Okrand). Reprinting of this list in
    any other work is prohibited without the express
