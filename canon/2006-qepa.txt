2006 -- {qep'a' wa'maH wejDIch}
-------------------------------
MO attended.

* {'elI'jaH} "unexpected visitor" (n) -- New word. Mark Okrand wrote the word
  in Angieszka Solska's notebook during {qep'a'} 2006, but she expected it to
  be published {HolQeD}, and did not want to spoil the surprise, therefore the
  word was not made public until a year later, in a discussion about new words
  from the next {qep'a'} on the tlhingan-hol mailing list.
