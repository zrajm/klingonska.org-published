2010 -- {qep'a' wa'maH SochDIch}
--------------------------------
A cadre of grammarians had the opportunity to preview a section of a Klingon
opera. In it we noted a smattering of tlhIngan Hol spellings for names of
various places, people, and plants. Someone wrote them down, but I did not
think them important enough at the time to record them myself.

{taHjaj wo'} was recorded on video by {qurgh}.

* {chalqach} "tower" (n)
* {maQ} "omen, sign" (n)
* {Qutlh} vs {ghaq} -- "Marc also clarified that {Qutlh} (support) can only
  refer to physically supporting something. It can't refer to monetary (he said
  {ghaq} is for this), psychological or any other non-physical type of
  support."
* {ruS} "bond", as between blood brothers (n)
* {Suto'vo'qor} "Sto-vo-kor" (n) -- Verified as correct.
