Everyday Klingon

Canonical Klingon is a precious and rare commodity, serendipitously
trickling down to us, whether as individual words which <{HolQeD}> is
fortunate enough to receive direct from Okrand or collections of sentences
painfully reconstructed from a Hallmark commercial.  One surprising source
continues to be the <Star Trek: The Next Generation> trading cards put out by
SkyBox International, Inc.  In <{HolQeD} 3:4> the text of three Klingon cards
from the first season's deck were presented.  Skybox appears to be [[Skybox:=SkyBox]]
continuing this tradition, and a visit to a recent convention yielded up six
new cards, three from the second season and three from the recently released
third season deck.  As with the original three, each card was translated into
Klingon by Marc Okrand.

From the <Star Trek: Next Generation,> second season card series by SkyBox
International, Inc.:

        S7    {qIvo'rIt <pagh'e'>}    K'Vort Class <Pagh>

    {qIvo'rIt toQDuj 'oH tlhIngan wo' Duj <pagh'e'>. ra' qarghan HoD.
    DujvamDaq tlhIngan nuH tu'lu'bogh pov law' Hoch pov puS 'ej
    DujvamDaq 'op SuvwI' tu'lu'bogh po' law' tlhIngan yo' SuvwI'
    law' po' puS.}

    The Imperial Klingon Vessel <Pagh> is a K'vort-class-Bird-of-Prey under [[class-Bird:=class Bird]]
    the command of Captain Kargan.  It has the best weapons and some
    of the finest warriors in the Klingon fleet.


        S8    Bat'telh, Klingon Sword of Honor [[, :=    ]]

    {qaStaHvIS wa'maH puq poHmey, wo'rIv batleH ghaj qorDu'Daj.
    nuja' tlhIngan wIch ja'wI'pu' yIntaHvIS qeylIS'e' lIjaHbe'bogh [[lIjaHbe'bogh:=lIjlaHbe'bogh]]
    vay' batlh 'etlhvam chenmoHlu'pu'.}

    Worf's bat'telh has been in his family for ten generations.
    According to Klingon legend, this sword of honor descends from the
    time of Kahless the Unforgettable.


        S9    {qaSDI' nenghep}    Age of Ascension

    {qaSDI' nenghep, qa' patlh chu' chav tlhIngan SuvwI'.  poSDaq
    nIHDaq je QamtaHvIS SuvwI'pu'.  chaH jojDaq yItnISlopwI'. [[yItnISlopwI':=yItnIS lopwI']]
    luchovmeH 'oy'naQmey lo'.}

    The Age of Ascension marks a new level of spiritual attainment by a
    Klingon warrior.  The initiate must pass through a gauntlet of
    warriors who test him with painsticks. [[p.5]]

And, from the <Star Trek: Next Generation,> third season card series by SkyBox
International, Inc.:

        S13    {tlhIngan qorDu' potlh}    Klingon Family Values

    {qorDu' lurDechmeyna' pab tlhInganpu'.  qorDu' SaHlu'chugh 'ej
    matlhlu'chugh vaj wa' tlhIngan ghob potlhqu'.  tlhIngan qorDu'
    pong potlh law' Hoch potlh puS.}

    With strong family traditions, devotion and loyalty to family is one
    of the most important Klingon virtues.  Above all, the Klingon
    family name is highly valued.


        S14    {tlhIngan nISwI' beH}    Klingon Disruptor Rifle

    {nISwI' HIch motlh HoS Hal qengwI' naQ tIq je lurarlu'bogh 'oH
    tlhIngan nISwI' beH'e'.  SuvwI' vI' Dub naQvam 'ej ray' HopDaq
    bachlu'meH chuqna' ghurmoH naQvam.}

    The Klingon disruptor rifle is a standard hand held disruptor,
    attached to an extended power supply stock.  This serves to steady
    the aim of a warrior and increase the effective range for distance
    targeting.


        S15    {tlhIngan may'Duj, qItI'nga}    Klingon Battlecruiser, K'Tinga-Class [[qItI'nga:=qItI'nga']]

    {wa'DIch tlhIngan Dujmey luleghlu'pu'bogh rur qItI'nga' Duj [[Duj:=Duj.]]
    tera' vatlh DIS poH cha'maH wej HochHom lo'lu'taH.  tera' vatlh
    DISpoH cha'maH loS bong QongmeH qItI'nga Duj tI'ang [[qItI'nga:=qItI'nga']]
    ghompu' DIvI' 'ejDo' 'entepray'.}

    Similar in configuration to the first Klingon vessels encountered, the
    K'Tinga-Class remained in use for most of the 23rd century.  A
    sleeper ship of this class, the T'Ong, was encountered in the 24th
    century by the <U.S.S. Enterprise>.


    And while these cards will surely bring us insights, questions, and much
discussion in the months ahead, one issue, the question about how to use
the conjunction {je} with more than two nouns is laid to rest by the copyright
notice on both cards: [[both:=all these]]
