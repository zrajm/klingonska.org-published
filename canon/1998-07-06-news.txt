Seems to me that the phrase that best fills in the blank ("I cannot be
insulted by (a) _______") is the one suggested a while back by both SuStel
and Qermaq: 

yIH ngaghwI'

(I'd leave the "a" in the English: "I cannot be insulted by a yIH
ngaghwI'.") 

If this is translated as "one who mates with a tribble," perhaps it sounds
too formal or clinical (in English, not in Klingon) to function as a curse
or insult.  If it's translated "tribble mater-wither" or something like
that, it has a somewhat better tone, but it's questionable English and
therefore lacks punch.  But English isn't the issue here; Klingon is, and,
unless I'm missing the point, /yIH ngaghwI'/ should work.  I trust that,
in the story, the Federation officer who utters the phrase is prepared for
what the Klingon may do next.
