That's all I know about this as well.  I thought the Ferengi language
sounded pretty good, and I really liked how they made use of it.   That is,
the "little green men" came to Earth -- specifically the United States in
the mid 20th Century -- and rather than speaking perfect mid 20th century
American English like most invading outer space aliens do, they spoke
something that the Earth people couldn't understand.

By incorporating the malfunction of the Universal Translators into the
plot, they even acknowledged that, even back in the 24th Century, there is
still a great deal of linguistic diversity and the potential for a lot of
misunderstanding.  

I don't know whether anyone at Paramount (or elsewhere) has actually
documented the Ferengi language (that is, whether there's a word list or
something like that).

There are, of course, a handful of Ferengi words we've heard in other
episodes (such as "Nagus" and "DaiMon"), and a number of Ferengi names, but 
extended Ferengi speech is, I think, heard only in the "Little Green Men"
episode.
