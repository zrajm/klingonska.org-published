Star Trek: The Motion Picture
=============================
Marc Okrand has always given full credit to James Doohan and Mark Lenard (who
plays the Klingon captain) for creating the eleven original words that he used
as the basis for {tlhIngan Hol}. (Not a great deal to base a whole language
upon really.) This is Okrand's version of the opening scene (done after the
fact) with the subtitles as they appeared in the movie:


Transcript
----------
Klingon captain: {wIy cha'}  
"Tactical..."

Klingon captain: {HaSta}  
"Visual..."

Klingon captain: {cha yIghuS}  
"Tactical, stand by on torpedoes."

Klingon captain: {'eH}  
"Ready..."

[Klingon captain raises his hand in preparation for the order to fire.]

Klingon captain: {SSS... baH}  
"Fire!"

Klingon captain: {junchoH}  
"Evasive!"
