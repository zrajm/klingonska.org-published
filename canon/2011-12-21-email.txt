I believe that on the final version of the board, the name vas changed to verengannar (can't check right now; perhaps somebody can confirm).

Also, 'anDorya' was changed to 'anDor (which is interesting, since people disagree on what the distinction is between Andor and Andoria; some claim one is the planet and the other the moon, while others claim "andor" is Andorian for "world", and -ia is some sort of augmentative suffix, so Andoria is "THE world"). Of course, for all we know, 'anDorya' is also correct (much like qarDaS and qarDaSya').

I think the Klingon spelling of Praxis is a bit unfortunate; it looks like a Klingon backfit of a Human name (like 'entepray'), rather than it being the other way around (I'd have liked something like *pIratlh or *pIra'tlhIH).

I used to think that *{vereng} was a short-form planet name in Klingon, perhaps used earlier in preference to *{verengannar}.

  verengan < ?verengngan < ?vereng + ngan

We've seen examples of such elision before:

  lIghongan < lIghonngan < lIghon + ngan

KGT 141:  A name for the inhabitant of a planet (and, therefore, the name of a race of beings) is formed by adding {ngan} (inhabitant) to the planet name (excluding the number, if any): {lIghonngan} (Ligonian) [...] (Actually, there is some phonetic variation here. Ligonian is often pronounced {lIghongan}, dropping the final {n} of {lIghon} before the initial {ng} of {ngan}. This is not considered an error, only an alternate pronunciation.)

Another example:

  vulgangan < ?vulganngan < vulqan + ngan (?)

The word {tlhIngan} itself may be a variation:

  tlhIngan < ?tlhIngngan < tlhIng + ngan (?)

N.B. There's a {tlhIng yoS} "Kling District" on Kronos.
