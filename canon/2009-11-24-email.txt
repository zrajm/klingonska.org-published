peqIm ghojwI'pu',

when I talked to Marc Okrand about the qepHom past weekend, I told him that it was difficult to describe my job as an architect in Klingon.

Here's is answer:

===============
I did see him [Maltz] earlier today as he was running off to grab a cup of coffee or something.   I told him about the lack of good words relating to architecture.  He said he wasn't an architect himself, so he'd have to think about that. But he did know the word for "plan" (the big piece of paper).  He said it's pu'jIn -- same as the word for "map."

Okay, now I'm curious to see if Maltz remembers anything else :-)

Qapla'
  Quvar.
