Talking about food, no new word, but an interesting explanation:

I asked if there were a word for "satisfied", "I'm full", i.e. you had 
eaten enough.

MO said no, but accepted {ghungHa'} for "not hungry any more". You 
cannot use it though to say that you are not hungry, that should be 
{ghungbe'} "not hungry". But if you are hungry first, then you eat 
enough, then you can say {DaH jIghungHa'} "Now I am un-hungry." (="not 
hungry any more")

It also works with {'oj} the same way.

Lieven.
