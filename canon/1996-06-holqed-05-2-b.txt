Everyday Klingon

We find ourselves possessed of an embarrassment of riches.  In this
quarter we have seen the release of our translation of <Hamlet,> Marc
Okrand's <Star Trek: The Klingon Way,> and Simon & Schuster <Star Trek: Klingon>
CD-ROM.  But we cannot stop there.  As they have for the previous three
years SkyBox International, Inc. has published three more Klingon trading
cards, these from the fourth season of <Star Trek: The Next Generation.>  As
before, the Klingon is attributed to Marc Okrand, thus making these entries
(including, arguably, the apparent typo on rokeg blood pie below) canonical.
Curiously, the entries found on these cards are considerably shorter than
those appearing on the previous three years' offerings.


        S19    {QumwI'}    Klingon Communicator

    {labmeH 'evnagh Se' tlhIngan QumwI'. janmey ngo' lulo'lu'DI' pIj [[Se':=Se' lo']]
    jabbI'ID nISpu' woj.}

    A Klingon communicator sends a signal through subspace radio.
    Older models were susceptible to radiation.


        S20    {Ha'quj}    Klingon Sash

    {qorDu'Daj tuq 'oS Ha'quje'e' tuQbogh wo'rIv. tuQtaHvIS Hem. [[SIC!]]
    qhaHvaD quHDaj qawmoH.}

    The sash that Worf wears is a symbol of his family's house. He wears
    it proudly as a reminder of his heritage.


        S21    {Soj}    Klingon Food

    {yIntaHbogh tlhIngan Soj tlhol jablu'Di' Hivqu'lu'. qagh, [[Di':=DI']] [[Hiv:=tIv]]
    ro'qegh'Iwachab, targh tIq Sop 'e' lungIl Humanpu' puS.}

    Klingon food is best when served fresh and live. Few humans dare
    to eat <gagh, rokeg> blood pie, or heart of <targ.>
