You're right!  /jeq/ means "protrude from."  The object of this verb would
be the thing from which something else (the subject) protrudes.  Thus,  
/chor jeq taj/ means "a knife protrudes from a belly" [/chor/ "belly,"
/taj/ "knife"].

I suppose this is a handy word to know if you're vacationing on Qo'noS.
