Klingon in Academia
===================

Below is a list of various academic papers written on the Klingon language
and/or its community of Klingon speakers here on Earth.

This attempt to collect these articles in one place, is in no way complete, and
there are probably many more articles to be found out there. If you've spotted
paper in the wild that we've failed to include below, [please send us a

          community, and though it is not tied to any university or other
          academic institution it has been included here because it has been
          cited in later works.

          Californian language Mutsun, and this paper sets out to compare
          Mutsun and Klingon and establish to what degree Marc Okrand took
          inspiration from Mutsun in his work on Klingon.
