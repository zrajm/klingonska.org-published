It's a Circle
(Direct translation of Klingon lyrics.)

As for the daytime star, see it in the sky. Hey, it's a circle.
Shoot a spear shaft. It goes through the *qa'vak* target. Hey, it's a circle.
As for the daytime star, see it in the sky.
Shoot a spear shaft. It goes through the *qa'vak* target.
If you fail, return to the task...
And it's a circle.

The motor's magnetic field is spinning a wheel. Hey, it's a circle.
As for a pie, bring it from a serving platter. Hey, it's a circle.
The motor's magnetic field is spinning a wheel.
As for a pie, bring it from a serving platter.
It makes me hungry. When does the midnight snack resume?
And it's a circle.

Can you see that cover?
Garbage hides itself beneath it.
It lacks sides. It has one true edge.
It's big and it's smooth and it's flat...
And it's a circle.

Consider the open mouth of one who is really shocked. Hey, it's a circle.
As for a flat sphere, how do you describe it? Hey, it's a circle.
Consider the open mouth of one who is really shocked.
As for a flat sphere, how do you describe it?
Take the sphere from the flattener...
And it's a circle.

As for the daytime star, see it in the sky. Hey, it's a circle.
Shoot a spear shaft. It goes through the *qa'vak* target. Hey, it's a circle.
As for the daytime star, see it in the sky.
Shoot a spear shaft. It goes through the *qa'vak* target.
If you fail, return to the task...
And it's a circle.

Original lyrics:

See the sun up in the sky. Well, it's a circle
See a hula hoop roll by. Well, it's a circle
See the sun up in the sky.
See a hula hoop roll by
Round as a fresh baked apple pie
And it's a circle

See a wheel on a roller skate. Well, it's a circle
See a cookie on a plate. Now that's a circle
See a wheel on a roller skate
See this cookie on a plate
Boy, this cookie sure is great
And it's a circle!

See that great big manhole cover
Lying on the ground
It's not a square or a triangle
It's big and flat and round-
And it's a circle

See a great big letter O. Well, it's a circle
See a bouncy ball, you know. That it's a circle
I like that great big letter O
I like that bouncy ball and so
The shape that we like best you know
Well, it's a circle
