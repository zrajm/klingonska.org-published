This song was taught to the participants of the {qep'a' chorghDIch} (in
Brussels, 2001) by Mark Shoulson. Apparently this is the original text of
the song know on Earth as "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" (a favourite song of,
among others, cpt. James T. Kirk and dr. Leonard McCoy). However, the mood
of the original Klingon song is somewhat different from the one we are used
to, and instead of a bunch of more or less random syllables, it tells the
sad story of two lovers, separated in battle.
