Which translates back as:

Gilligans world

Sit and then a tale you'll hear
A tale of a fated trip
That started from a tropical planet
Aboard a tiny ship

The first officer was a skilled navigator
The captain was brave and trustworthy
Five passengers departed on that day
For a three-hour voyage
For a three-hour voyage

The solar winds became extremely rough
The ship lost control
If the crew had not been very brave
The "Minnow" would have been lost
The "Minnow" would have been lost

The ship crashed hard on the surface
Of an uncharted, desert planet...
The people were:
Gilligan and the Captain
The very rich man and his wife
The actress, the engineer,
And Mary-Ann

Here on Gilligan's World

-------------------------------------------
Original lyrics:

Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale,
a tale of a fateful trip.
That started from this tropic port,
aboard this tiny ship.

The mate was a mighty sailin' man,
the skipper brave and sure.
Five passengers set sail that day,
for a three hour tour,
a three hour tour???

The weather started getting rough,
the tiny ship was tossed.
If not for the courage of the fearless crew,
the Minnow would be lost;
the Minnow would be lost.

The ship took ground on the shore
of this uncharted desert isle,
with Gilligan, the Skipper too,
the Millionaire, and his Wife,
the Movie Star, the Professor and Mary Ann,
here on Gilligan's Isle.


This one was sent to me by Knightsfyre <knightsfyre@canada.com>. I
have never heard this song sung (neither in Klingon nor in the
original), so I don't know if the Klingon translation fits the
original melody.

Translated by Paul Lacroix <crossfyretheknight@yahoo.com>:

  I think a couple of word placements might be wrong, grammar-wise,
  looking at it again (the wording of "The actress, the engineer, and
  Mary-Ann, for instance; the "and" conjunction is supposed to go at
  the end of the phrasing, but I'm unclear how it works in a short
  list.  I'll look at it again

  Since I simply wrote the English lyrics out and hashed out the
  Klingon word-for-word (or as close as possible), I don't think
  there's any other musical source for this.


Comment by Justin Raines <justinraines@prodigy.net>:

  Gilligan's Island is a show from the late 60's.  It was a comedy
  produced by CBS, in America.  It isn't for children, but it is quite
  funny. I suggest you try to watch an old video of Gilligan's Island,
  'tis fairly enjoyable.
