Hilary Bader's lyrics

Hear, sons of Kahless!
Hear, daughters too!
The blood of battle washes clean.
The warrior brave and true.
We fight, we love, and then we kill.
Our lives burn short and bright.
Then we die with honor and join our fathers
  in the Black Fleet where we battle forever,
  battling on through the Eternal fight.

---------------------------------------------


Literal translation

Hear, sons of Kahless!
Hear, daughters!
The battle's blood perfectly cleans the warrior who is brave and loyal.
We fight, we're passionate, and we kill perfectly.
Our lives are not long, but they're very bright.
We certainly die with honor, and we join our fathers in the black fleet.
There we always really continue fighting.
We won't stop. We continue fighting. We compete.
