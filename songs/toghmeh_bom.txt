toghmeH bom
qonwI': Mark Shoulson

A children's song, with a verse for each number form zero to nine. As with
many old children's rhymes in many cultures, it doesn't completely
conform to modern sentiments. A few Klingons find the starred verses
inappropriate for teaching to impressionable youth, anda ccordingly omit
verse #0 and replace verse #3 with the revised version shown in parentheses.
Most Klingons consider this sort of tampering with a beloved old nursery
rhyme to be silly and excessive.

[[Transcriber's note: I spoke to Mark Shoulson about this song during the
{qep'a' chorghDIch}, and actually got him to perform it during the {qep'a'}
cabaret (in spite of vague protests from himself and Lawrence Shoen). The
melody is invented by Mark Shoulson, and from what I remember quite simple
(as it should be, being a children's song and all). Unfortunately I'm unable
to recall the melody in total. (I should have brough a tape recorder to this
{qep'a'} too...) ]]
