Songs in Klingon
================
This is a page for Klingon music (and lyrics). I’m collecting all material that
I can get a hold of, so you have the lyrics to a song (<i>any song</i>) in this
harsh language why not send it to me for inclusion here?

I would also like to make recordings of the songs available here, so that you
may hear the melody. It won’t be high quality recordings (that would eat to
many kilobytes) and most likely they won’t be all that fancy either. Maybe just
one unaccompanied voice to get the melody across.

If you have such a recording, or if you’re willing to make one, then [send it
to me](mailto:zrajm@klingonska)!

  <dt><a href="dahjaj_po.txt">{DaHjaj po} -- <i>An Imperial Parody</i></a>
  <dd><i>Music by Rich Yampell in 1993, lyrics by {’altaQ}.</i>
    <br>This is a parody version of <a href="tahjaj_wo/">{taHjaj
    wo’}</a>. <small>[Changed 2007-07-15]</small>

  <dt><a href="gilligans_island.txt">{ghIlI’qan qo’} -- Gilligan’s
    Island</a>
  <dd>This is a translation of the »Gilligan’s Island« theme song, sent to me
    by Knightsfyre. I don’t know if it’s possible to sing it to the original
    melody, since I’ve never heard the song (nor watched the show). If you can
    give me any information regarding writer, and year it was written I’d
    greatly appreciate it. <small>[Changed 2007-07-15]</small>

  <dt><a href="gho_oh.txt">{gho ’oH} -- <<It’s a Circle>></a>
  <dd>This is a translation of the Sesame Street song called “The Circle Song”.
    Translation made by Alan Anderson. (Please correct me if I’m wrong, my
    email address is
    email <a href="mailto:zrajm@klingonska.org">zrajm@klingonska.org</a>.)
    Thanks to Agnieszka Solska for sending me the
    lyrics. <small>[Changed 2009-12-05]</small>

  <dt><a href="qumbaya.txt">{qumbaya} -- <<Kum ba yah>></a>
  <dd><i>Lyrics by unknown, trad. melody.</i>
    <br>One of the more playful songs I know of in
    Klingon. <small>[Changed 2007-07-15]</small>

  <dt><a href="ro_yibot.txt">{ro’ ro’ ro’ yIbot} -- <i>Row, Row, Row Your
    Boat</i></a>
  <dd><i>Lyrics by Mark Shoulson(?), trad. melody.</i>
    <br>This is the original lyrics to the song most commonly known on Earth as
    “Row, Row, Row Your Boat”. It is not just a translation of the meaningless
    Terran lyrics, but a complete restoration in which it becomes apparent what
    the song really is all about. <small>[Changed 2007-07-15]</small>

  <dt><a href="anthem/">{SuvwI’ van bom} -- <<The Warrior’s Anthem>></a>
  <dd><i>Music by Paramount Pictures 1993, English & Klingon lyrics by Hillary
    Bader 1997, Klingon title by Marc Okrand(?) 1997.</i>
    <br>Also known as “The Klingon Anthem”. This song was first heard (in it’s
    Paramount Hol version) in the TNG eposode “Birthright, Part II”, and then
    again in the computer game “Star Trek: Klingon”. Later on Hillary Bader
    wrote lyrics in English and {tlhIngan Hol} (see also
    KGT p.175). <small>[Changed 2011-07-19]</small>

  <dt><a href="tahjaj_wo/">{taHjaj wo’} -- <i>An Imperial Anthem</i></a>
  <dd><i>By Rich Yampell 1993.</i>
    <br>This is a hymn in honor of the Klingon Empire. It has been sung at all
    of the {qep’a’mey}. Hearing this song sung by a dozen or more klingonists,
    and in its full three part harmony, is really beautiful. There’s even a
    parody of it, called <a href="dahjaj_po.txt">{DaHjaj po}</a> (see
    above). <small>[Changed 2010-11-05]</small>

  <dt><a href="toghmeh_bom.txt">{toghmeH bom} -- <<A Song for Counting>></a>
  <dd><i>By Mark Shoulson in 1999.</i>
    <br>A children’s counting song, with one verse for each number between zero
    and nine. <small>[Changed 2007-07-15]</small>

  <dt><a href="yih_bom.txt">{yIH bom} -- <<The Tribble Song>></a>
  <dd><i>Lyrics by Lawrence Schoen, music by Rich Yampell, written in 2000.</i>
    <br>This is a song intended for the bar room. It was first sung by Lawrence
    at the {qep’a’ SochDIch} and then we all got to sing along. (The {qep’a’}
    had a tribble theme, and the song was written specifically for the
    occasion.) <small>[Changed 2007-07-15]</small>

  <dt><a href="yih_ghupbogh_be_qan.txt">{yIH ghupbogh be’ qan} -- <<There Was
    an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly>></a>
  <dd><i>Lyrics by David Trimboli in 1997, trad. melody.</i>
    <br>The original version of a beloved Klingon nursery rhyme with the {jat
    qaD} still intact. <small>[Changed 2007-07-15]</small>

  <dt><a href="america.html"><b lang=tlh><i>’amerIqa</i> luHo’qu’taH Hoch</b>
    -- <i class=translation lang=sv>Alla älskar vi Amerika</i> (“<<We All Love
    America>>”)</i></a>
  <dd><i>Music and lyrics by <span lang=sv>Den Förlorade Generationen</span>
    (“The Lost Generation”) in 1999(?), translated by zrajm and Markus Persson
    in 2000.</i>
    <br>This song was originally written in Swedish, but at the request of the
    band who wrote it, we translated it into
    Klingon. <small>[Changed 2007-07-15]</small>

  <dt><a href="iv_mah.txt">{’Iv maH} -- <<Who are we?>></a>
  <dd><i>By Rich Yampell in 1999.</i>
    <br>This is the KLI theme song. It was recorded at the {qep’a’ SochDIch} by
    a choir consisting of all attendants. (Including, among others: myself,
    Markus Persson, Captain Krankor, Mark Soulson, Lawrence Schoen, Will
    Martin, and some guy called Marc Okrand.) This recording will probably
    become a CD (this was the intention as far as I
    know). <small>[Changed 2007-07-15]</small>

The summer of 2001, when I went to my second {qep’a’} (this time in Brussels),
I learned that there really are quite a few more songs around in Klingon than I
previously thought. So, I made a list of songs that got to know the name of so
that I would know the name of my prey and be able to hunt down the lyrics a bit
easier. This is my list:

<dl class=navigation>
  <dt>“Good Morning Starshine” (by Mark Shoulson)
  <dd>This is a translation of one of the songs from the musical “Hair”.

  <dt>{Subma’} (by Eric Andeen)
  <dt>“The Noun Song” (a Sesame Street song translated by Alan Anderson)

  <dt>{taj} Song (a work-in-progress by Mark Shoulson)
  <dd>If I remember correctly, this has something to do with knives and
    forks.

  <dt>&lt;unknown title&gt; (a work-in-progress by Lawrence Schoen)
  <dd>This song is the story of a warrior which loses body part after body part
    in various battles. But he doesn’t care, because he knowns that he’ll be
    given them all back by Kahless the day he dies.

  <dt>A Klingon Lullaby (by d’Armond Speers)
  <dd>This lullaby was read to us at the {qep’a’ chorghDIch} cabaret. According
    to d’Armond the lyrics (there is no melody to it, at least not yet) is a
    part of a larger novel he is writing.
