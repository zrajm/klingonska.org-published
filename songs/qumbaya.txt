This song was sung by the participants of the {qep'a' chorghDIch} (in
Brussels, 2001), and is a translation of a traditional gospel song
called "Kum ba yah". (Thanks {nI'taQ} "www.geocities.com/TPaichaSorik"
for the correct English title.)

You are supposed to sing the many times over and over, each time changing
the initial verb to something else. I think the original uses the words
{Qong} "sleep" and {bom} "sing", but we had a great time singing (very
badly) {chech}, or beating the rhythm of the song on the table while singing
{tlhaw'}.
